In the case of high-dimensional data sets, though, interactive exploratory data visualization can give far more insight than an approach where data processing and statistical analysis are followed, rather than accompanied, by visualization. This paper attempts to charts a course toward “linked view” systems, where multiple views of high-dimensional data sets update live as a researcher selects, highlights, or otherwise manipulates, one of several open views. For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization of simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays of the data set's properties (such as an x -y plot of temperature vs. velocity, or a histogram of vorticities). Then, imagine that when the researcher selects an interesting group of points in any one of these displays, that the same points become a highlighted subset in all other open displays. Selections can be graphical or algorithmic, and they can be combined, and saved. For tabular (ASCII) data, this kind of analysis has long been possible, even though it has been under-used in astronomy. The bigger issue for astronomy and other “high-dimensional” fields, though, is that no extant system allows for full integration of images and data cubes within a linked-view environment. The paper concludes its history and analysis of the present situation with suggestions that look toward cooperatively-developed open-source modular software as a way to create an evolving, flexible, high-dimensional, linked-view visualization environment useful in astro-physical research (© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The software application was used to calibrate magnitudes for six Be/X-ray binary sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the results were compared with published results for these sources.

As has been demonstrated by various authors, for many applications the choice of input SPS models can be a significant source of systematic uncertainty. A key strength of EzGal is that it enables simple, direct comparison of different model sets so that the uncertainty introduced by choice of model set can be quantified. Its ability to work with new models will allow EzGal to remain useful as SPS modeling evolves to keep up with the latest research (such as varying IMFs). EzGal is also capable of generating composite stellar population models (CSPs) for arbitrary input star-formation histories and reddening laws, and it can be used to interpolate between metallicities for a given model set. To facilitate use, we have created an online interface to run EzGal and quickly generate magnitude and mass-to-light ratio predictions for a variety of star-formation histories and model sets. We make many commonly used SPS models available from the online interface, including the canonical Bruzual & Charlot models, an updated version of these models, the Maraston models, the BaSTI models, and the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) models. We use EzGal to compare magnitude predictions for the model sets as a function of wavelength, age, metallicity, and star-formation history. From this comparison we quickly recover the well-known result that the models agree best in the optical for old solar-metallicity models, with differences at the ˜0.1 level. Similarly, the most problematic regime for SPS modeling is for young ages (≲2 Gyr) and long wavelengths (λ≳7500 Å), where thermally pulsating AGB stars are important and scatter between models can vary from 0.3 mag (Sloan i) to 0.7 mag (Ks). We find that these differences are not caused by one discrepant model set and should therefore be interpreted as general uncertainties in SPS modeling. Finally, we connect our results to a more physically motivated example by generating CSPs with a star-formation history matching the global star-formation history of the universe. We demonstrate that the wavelength and age dependence of SPS model uncertainty translates into a redshift-dependent model uncertainty, highlighting the importance of a quantitative understanding of model differences when comparing observations with models as a function of redshift.","2012-06-01","2013-04-17 00:49:19","2013-04-17 00:49:19","2013-04-17 00:49:19","606-615","","","124","","Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific","EzGal","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2012/Mancone y Gonzalez - 2012 - EzGal.pdf","","","Data Analysis and Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J.","PICACS: self-consistent modelling of galaxy cluster scaling relations","arXiv:1212.0858 [astro-ph]","","","","http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0858","In this paper, we introduce PICACS, a physically-motivated, internally consistent model of scaling relations between galaxy cluster masses and their observable properties. This model can be used to constrain simultaneously the form, scatter (including its covariance) and evolution of the scaling relations, as well as the masses of the individual clusters. In this framework, scaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity and temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental mass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being fit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show that it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring individual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on the processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass constraints. Our analysis suggests that the observed combination of slopes of the scaling relations can be described by a deficit of gas in low-mass clusters that is compensated for by elevated gas temperatures, such that the total thermal energy of the gas in a cluster of given mass remains close to self-similar expectations. This is interpreted as the result of AGN feedback removing low entropy gas from low mass systems, while heating the remaining gas. We deconstruct the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation and show that its steepening compared to self-similar expectations can be explained solely by this combination of gas depletion and heating in low mass systems, without any additional contribution from a mass dependence of the gas structure. Finally, we demonstrate that a self-consistent analysis of the scaling relations leads to an expectation of self-similar evolution of the LT relation that is significantly weaker than is commonly assumed.","2012-12-04","2014-02-26 12:42:35","2014-02-26 12:42:35","2014-02-26 12:42:35","","","","","","","PICACS","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2012/Maughan - 2012 - PICACS.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the photo-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as ~1% for simulated and ~2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely thousands of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as an user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort from the user. By facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.","2014-09-01","2014-10-05 02:32:40","2014-10-05 02:32:40","2014-10-05 02:32:40","7699","","","1409","","ArXiv e-prints","The Overlooked Potential of Generalized Linear Models in Astronomy-II","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2014/Elliott et al. - 2014 - The Overlooked Potential of Generalized Linear Models in Astronomy-II.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics; Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This first paper covers the basic version of our code which treats the relaxation-driven evolution of a stellar cluster without a central BH. A technical description of the code is presented, as well as the results of test computations. Thanks to the use of a binary tree to store potential and rank information and of variable time steps, cluster models with up to 2*E6 particles can be simulated on a standard personal computer and the CPU time required scales as Np ln (Np) with the particle number Np.

With the advent of multicore processors in the last decade, many serial software codes have been re-implemented in parallel mode to utilize the full potential of these processors. In this paper, we propose parallel processing recipes for multicore machines for astronomical data processing. The target audience is astronomers who use Python as their preferred scripting language and who may be using PyRAF/IRAF for data processing. Three problems of varied complexity were benchmarked on three different types of multicore processors to demonstrate the benefits, in terms of execution time, of parallelizing data processing tasks. The native multiprocessing module available in Python makes it a relatively trivial task to implement the parallel code. We have also compared the three multiprocessing approaches—Pool/Map, Process/Queue and Parallel Python.

A drawback of this dynamic language, however, is its low runtime performance which limits its applicability for large simulations and for the analysis of large data sets, as is common in astrophysics and cosmology. While various frameworks have been developed to address this limitation, most focus on covering the complete language set, and either force the user to alter the code or are not able to reach the full speed of an optimised native compiled language. In order to combine the ease of Python and the speed of C++, we developed HOPE, a specialised Python just-in-time (JIT) compiler designed for numerical astrophysical applications. HOPE focuses on a subset of the language and is able to translate Python code into C++ while performing numerical optimisation on mathematical expressions at runtime. To enable the JIT compilation, the user only needs to add a decorator to the function definition. We assess the performance of HOPE by performing a series of benchmarks and compare its execution speed with that of plain Python, C++ and the other existing frameworks. We find that HOPE improves the performance compared to plain Python by a factor of 2 to 120, achieves speeds comparable to that of C++, and often exceeds the speed of the existing solutions. We discuss the differences between HOPE and the other frameworks, as well as future extensions of its capabilities.

An automatic tool to derive structural parameters of semi-resolved star clusters located in crowded stellar fields in nearby galaxies is needed for homogeneous processing of archival frames. Aims. We have developed a program that automatically derives the structural parameters of star clusters and estimates errors by accounting for individual stars and variable sky background. Methods. Models of observed frames consist of the cluster's surface brightness distribution, convolved with a point spread function; the stars, represented by the same point spread function; and a smoothly variable sky background. The cluster's model is fitted within a large radius by using the Levenberg-Marquardt and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to derive structural parameters, the flux of the cluster, and individual fluxes of all well-resolved stars. Results. FitClust, a program to derive structural parameters of semi-resolved clusters in crowded stellar fields, was developed and is available for free use. The program was tested on simulated cluster frames, and was used to measure clusters of the M31 galaxy in Subaru Suprime-Cam frames. Conclusions. Accounting for bright resolved stars and variable sky background significantly improves the accuracy of derived structural parameters of star clusters. However, their uncertainty remains dominated by the stochastic noise of unresolved stars.","2014-09","2015-06-08 18:57:05","2016-08-15 14:02:11","2015-06-08 18:57:05","A30","","","569","","","Deriving structural parameters of semi-resolved star clusters.

Classical problems in Astronomy are compounded by accumulation of astronomical volume of complex data, rendering the task of classification and interpretation incredibly laborious. The presence of noise in the data makes analysis and interpretation even more arduous. Machine learning algorithms and data analytic techniques provide the right platform for the challenges posed by these problems. A diverse range of open problem like star-galaxy separation, detection and classification of exoplanets, classification of supernovae is discussed. The focus of the paper is the applicability and efficacy of various machine learning algorithms like K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na\""ive Bayes and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in analysis and inference of the decision theoretic problems in Astronomy.

We applied the code to the peak bagging analysis of solar-like oscillations observed in a challenging F-type star. By means of Diamonds one is able to detect the different backgrounds in the power spectrum of the star (e.g. stellar granulation and faculae activity) and to understand whether one or two oscillation peaks can be identified or not. In addition, we demonstrate a novel approach to peak bagging based on multimodality, which is able to reduce significantly the number of free parameters involved in the peak bagging model.

We show that our results are in good agreement with the CMD ages for both models, and that metallicity does not affect the age determination for the full spectrum fitting method regardless of the model used for ages with log (age/year) $<$ 9. We discuss the results obtained by the two statistical results for both GALAXEV and MILES versus three factors: age, S/N and resolution (FWHM). The predicted reddening values when using the $\chi^{2}$ minimization method are within the range found in the literature for resolved clusters (i.e: $<$ 0.35), however the K-S test can predict E(B$-$V) higher values. The sharp spectrum transition originated at ages around the supergiants contribution, at either side of the AGB peak around log (age/year) 9.0 and log (age/year) 7.8 are limiting our ability to provide values in agreement with the CMD estimates and as a result the reddening determination is not accurate.

Using MATISSE it will be no longer needed to download huge quantity of data or to write down a specific code for every instrument analysed, greatly encouraging studies based on joint analysis of different datasets.

Classifying them reliably is however a challenging task due to degeneracies in WISE multicolour space and low levels of detection in its two longest-wavelength bandpasses. Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and reliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source classification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification will employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those reliably measured for a majority of sources. For the automatic classification we applied the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm, which requires a training sample with relevant classes already identified, and we chose to use the SDSS spectroscopic dataset for that purpose. By calibrating the classifier on the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel is preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset. Next, using three classification parameters (W1 magnitude, W1-W2 colour, and a differential aperture magnitude) we obtained very good classification efficiency in all the tests. At the bright end, the completeness for stars and galaxies reaches ~95%, deteriorating to ~80% at W1=16 mag, while for quasars it stays at a level of ~95% independently of magnitude. Similar numbers are obtained for purity. Application of the classifier to full-sky WISE data, flux-limited to 16 mag (Vega) in the 3.4 $\mu$m channel, and appropriate a posteriori cleaning allowed us to obtain reliably-looking catalogues of star and galaxy candidates. However, the sources flagged by the classifier as `quasars' are in fact dominated by dusty galaxies but also exhibit contamination from sources located mainly at low ecliptic latitudes, consistent with Solar System objects.","2016-04-14","2016-04-15 12:47:45","2016-11-11 12:56:49","2016-04-15 12:47:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2016/Kurcz et al. - 2016 - Towards automatic classification of all WISE sources.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies; Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics; Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regridding algorithm is based on the convolution of the original samples with a kernel of arbitrary shape. We introduce a lookup table scheme that allows us to parallelize the gridding and combine it with the HEALPix tessellation of the sphere for fast neighbor searches. We show that for $n$ input data points, cygrids runtime scales between O(n) and O(n log n) and analyze the performance gain that is achieved using multiple CPU cores. We also compare the gridding speed with other techniques, such as nearest-neighbor, and linear and cubic spline interpolation.

We present a software package $\mathtt{ComEst}$, which calculates the completeness of source detection on charge-coupled device (CCD) images of astronomical observations, especially for the optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging of galaxies and point sources. The completeness estimator $\mathtt{ComEst}$ is designed for the source finder $\mathtt{SExtractor}$ used on the CCD images saved in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format. Specifically, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ estimates the completeness of the source detection by deriving the detection rate of synthetic point sources and galaxies simulated on the observed CCD images. In order to capture any observational artifacts or noise properties while deriving the completeness, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ directly carries out the detection of simulated sources on the observed images. Given an observed CCD image saved in FITS format, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ derives the completeness of the source detection from end to end as a function of source flux (or magnitude) and CCD position. In addition, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ can also estimate the purity of the source detection by comparing the catalog of the detected sources to the input catalogs of the simulated sources. We run ComEst on the images from Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and compare the derived completeness as a function of magnitude to the limiting magnitudes derived by using the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and number count histogram of the detected sources. $\mathtt{ComEst}$ is released as a Python package with an easy-to-use syntax and is publicly available at https://github.com/inonchiu/ComEst","2016-05-09","2016-05-10 12:15:20","2016-11-11 12:56:46","2016-05-10 12:15:20","","","","","","","$\mathtt{ComEst}$","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2016/Chiu et al. - 2016 - ComEst.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variations of the IMF with galaxy type and/or formation time may have important consequences for our understanding of galaxy evolution. We have developed a new stellar population synthesis (SPS) code specifically designed to reconstruct the IMF. We implement a novel approach combining regularization with hierarchical Bayesian inference. Within this approach we use a parametrized IMF prior to regulate a direct inference of the IMF. This direct inference gives more freedom to the IMF and allows the model to deviate from parametrized models when demanded by the data. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to reconstruct the best parameters for the IMF prior, the age, and the metallicity of a single stellar population. We present our code and apply our model to a number of mock single stellar populations with different ages, metallicities, and IMFs. When systematic uncertainties are not significant, we are able to reconstruct the input parameters that were used to create the mock populations. Our results show that if systematic uncertainties do play a role, this may introduce a bias on the results. Therefore, it is important to objectively compare different ingredients of SPS models. Through its Bayesian framework, our model is well-suited for this.","2016-08-17","2016-08-20 02:27:01","2016-11-11 12:56:38","2016-08-20 02:27:01","stw2049","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2016/Dries et al. - 2016 - A hierarchical Bayesian approach for reconstructing the Initial Mass Function.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However each image is affected by an instrumental response, also known as PSF, that depends on the characteristics of the instrument as well as the wavelength and the observing strategy. Given the knowledge of the PSF in each band, a straightforward way of processing images is to homogenise them all to a target PSF using convolution kernels, so that they appear as if they had been acquired by the same instrument. We propose an algorithm that generates such PSF-matching kernels, based on Wiener filtering with a tunable regularisation parameter. This method ensures all anisotropic features in the PSFs to be taken into account. We compare our method to existing procedures using measured Herschel/PACS and SPIRE PSFs and simulated JWST/MIRI PSFs.

Moreover, the BIE is implements a full persistence or serialisation system that stores the full byte-level image of the running inference and previously characterised posterior distributions for later use. Two new algorithms to compute the marginal likelihood from the posterior distribution, developed for and implemented in the BIE, enable model comparison for complex models and data sets. Finally, the BIE was designed to be a collaborative platform for applying Bayesian methodology to astronomy. It includes an extensible object-oriented and easily extended framework that implements every aspect of the Bayesian inference. By providing a variety of statistical algorithms for all phases of the inference problem, a scientist may explore a variety of approaches with a single model and data implementation.

Effective exploitation of such surveys requires a largely automated data-reduction process. This paper introduces an end-to-end automated reduction pipeline, AMIsurvey, used for calibrating and imaging data from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array. AMIsurvey makes use of several component libraries which have been packaged separately for open-source release. The most scientifically significant of these is chimenea, which implements a telescope-agnostic algorithm for automated imaging of pre-calibrated multi-epoch radio-synthesis data, of the sort typically acquired for transient surveys or follow-up. The algorithm aims to improve upon standard imaging pipelines by utilizing iterative RMS-estimation and automated source-detection to avoid so called `Clean-bias', and makes use of CASA subroutines for the underlying image-synthesis operations. At a lower level, AMIsurvey relies upon two libraries, drive-ami and drive-casa, built to allow use of mature radio-astronomy software packages from within Python scripts. While targeted at automated imaging, the drive-casa interface can also be used to automate interaction with any of the CASA subroutines from a generic Python process. Additionally, these packages may be of wider technical interest beyond radio-astronomy, since they demonstrate use of the Python library pexpect to emulate terminal interaction with an external process. This approach allows for rapid development of a Python interface to any legacy or externally-maintained pipeline which accepts command-line input, without requiring alterations to the original code.","2015-05-29","2015-09-16 23:03:05","2016-09-28 13:38:21","2015-09-16 23:03:05","","","","","","","Chimenea and other tools","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2015/Staley y Anderson - 2015 - Chimenea and other tools.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relying on a sufficient number of background stars for image registration and photometric calibration, PP is well-suited to analyze data from small to medium-sized telescopes. Calibrated magnitudes obtained by PP are accurate within ≤ 0.05 mag and astrometric accuracies are of the order of 0.3 arcsec relative to the catalogs used in the registration. The pipeline consists of an open-source software suite written in Python 2.7 and utilizes freely available software for some tasks. PP can be run on Unix-based systems on a simple desktop machine and is capable of realtime data analysis.

Many tools have been developed to confront this challenge. However, they usually focus on displaying the actual images or focus on visualizing patterns within catalogs in a predefined way. In this paper we introduce Vizic, a Python visualization library that builds the connection between images and catalogs through an interactive map of the sky region. Vizic visualizes catalog data over a custom background canvas using the shape, size and orientation of each object in the catalog. The displayed objects in the map are highly interactive and customizable comparing to those in the images. These objects can be filtered by or colored by their property values, such as redshift and magnitude. They also can be sub-selected using a lasso-like tool for further analysis using standard Python functions from inside a Jupyter notebook. Furthermore, Vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of the sky map. We have initially implemented several overlays, namely, Voronoi, Delaunay, Minimum Spanning Tree and HEALPix layers, which are helpful for visualizing large-scale structure. All these overlays can be generated, added or removed dynamically with just one line of code. The catalog data is kept in a non-relational database, and the interfaces were developed in JavaScript and Python to work within Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create custom widgets, user generated scripts to analyze and plot the data selected/displayed in the interactive map. This unique design makes Vizic a very powerful and flexible interactive analysis tool. Vizic can be adopted in variety of exercises, for example, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies, outlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations.","2017-01-01","2017-01-06 15:41:56","2017-01-06 18:32:08","2017-01-06 15:41:56","arXiv:1701.01222","","","1701","","ArXiv e-prints","Vizic","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","1","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2017/Yu et al. 2017 - Vizic.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics; Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modern object detection algorithms in astronomy are oriented towards detection of stars and galaxies, ignoring completely detection of existing linear features. With the emergence of wide field sky surveys, linear features attract scientific interest as possible trails of fast flybys of near-Earth asteroids and meteors. In this work we describe a new linear feature detection algorithm designed specifically for implementation in Big Data astronomy. The algorithm combines a series of algorithmic steps that first remove other objects (stars, galaxies) from the image and then enhance the line to enable more efficient line detection with the Hough algorithm. The rate of false positives is greatly reduced thanks to a step that replaces possible line segments with rectangles and then compares lines fitted to the rectangles with the lines obtained directly from the image. The speed of the algorithm and its applicability in astronomical surveys are also discussed.","2016-12-14","2016-12-15 13:26:24","2016-12-15 13:26:44","2016-12-15 13:26:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2016/Bektešević_Vinković 2016 Linear feature detection algorithm for astronomical surveys - I.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ProFit consists of a low-level C++ library (libprofit), accessible via a command-line interface and documented API, along with high-level R (ProFit) and Python (PyProFit) interfaces (available at github.com/ICRAR/ libprofit, github.com/ICRAR/ProFit, and github.com/ICRAR/pyprofit respectively). R ProFit is also available pre-built from CRAN, however this version will be slightly behind the latest GitHub version. libprofit offers fast and accurate two- dimensional integration for a useful number of profiles, including Sersic, Core-Sersic, broken-exponential, Ferrer, Moffat, empirical King, point-source and sky, with a simple mechanism for adding new profiles. We show detailed comparisons between libprofit and GALFIT. libprofit is both faster and more accurate than GALFIT at integrating the ubiquitous Serrsic profile for the most common values of the Serrsic index n (0.5 < n < 8). The high-level fitting code ProFit is tested on a sample of galaxies with both SDSS and deeper KiDS imaging. We find good agreement in the fit parameters, with larger scatter in best-fit parameters from fitting images from different sources (SDSS vs KiDS) than from using different codes (ProFit vs GALFIT). A large suite of Monte Carlo-simulated images are used to assess prospects for automated bulge-disc decomposition with ProFit on SDSS, KiDS and future LSST imaging. We find that the biggest increases in fit quality come from moving from SDSS- to KiDS-quality data, with less significant gains moving from KiDS to LSST.","2016-11-22","2016-11-28 18:08:53","2016-11-28 18:19:49","2016-11-28 18:08:53","","","","","","","ProFit","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2016/Robotham et al 2016 ProFit.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies; Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics; Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has likely led to the predicament that the body of the literature is too large for traditional human consumption and that related and crucial knowledge is not discovered by researchers. In addition to the increased production of astronomical literature, recent decades have also brought several advancements in computer linguistics. Especially, the machine aided processing of literature dissemination might make it possible to convert this stream of papers into a coherent knowledge set. In this paper, we present the application of computer linguistics techniques on astronomy literature. In particular, we developed a tool that will find similar articles purely based on text content given an input paper. We find that our technique performs robustly in comparison with other tools recommending articles given a reference papers (known as recommender system).

In this paper we present a new technique, PNICER, that estimates intrinsic colors and extinction for individual stars using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the column density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any combination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions. Furthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single sources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction vector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes possible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability densities. PNICER effectively eliminates known biases found in similar methods and outperforms them in cases of deep observational data where the number of background galaxies is significant, or when a large number of parameters is used to break degeneracies in the intrinsic color distributions. This new method remains computationally competitive, making it possible to correctly de-redden millions of sources within a matter of seconds. With the ever-increasing number of large-scale high-sensitivity imaging surveys, PNICER offers a fast and reliable way to efficiently calculate extinction for arbitrary parameter combinations without prior information on source characteristics. PNICER also offers access to the well-established NICER technique in a simple unified interface and is capable of building extinction maps including the NICEST correction for cloud substructure. PNICER is offered to the community as an open-source software solution and is entirely written in Python.","2017-02-01","2017-03-01 14:42:40","2017-03-01 15:32:43","","arXiv:1702.08456","","","1702","","ArXiv e-prints","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","1","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2017/Meingast et al. 2017 - Estimating Extinction using Unsupervised Machine Learning.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies; Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics; Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, a common source of error is the access to invalid memory regions, which produces random execution behaviors and affects the scientific interpretation of the results. In 2015, Mozilla Research released the first stable version of a new programming language named Rust. Many features make this new language attractive for the scientific community, it is open source and it guarantees memory safety while offering zero-cost abstraction.

For our sample of 715 software instances in the 166 articles we examined, we were able to categorize 418 records as to availability of source code and found that 285 unique codes were used, 58% of which offer source code available online for download. Of the 2,558 hyperlinks extracted from 1,669 research articles, at best, 90% of them were available over our testing period.","2018-01-01","2018-02-14 00:16:03","2018-02-14 01:45:06","2018-02-14 00:16:03","arXiv:1801.02094","","","1801","","ArXiv e-prints","Schroedinger's code","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","2","","/home/gabriel/Dropbox/apps_sync/Zot/2018/Allen et al 2018 - Schroedinger's code.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics; Computer Science - Digital Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
