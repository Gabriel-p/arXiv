2018-02-13,1,"WIYN Open Cluster Study, LXXVI. Li Evolution Among Stars of  Low/Intermediate Mass: The Metal-Deficient Open Cluster, NGC 2506 HYDRA spectra of 287 stars in the field of NGC 2506 from the turnoff through the giant branch are analyzed. With previous data, 22 are identified as probable binaries; 90 more are classified as potential non-members. Spectroscopic analyses of ~60 red giants and slowly rotating turnoff stars using line equivalent widths and a neural network approach lead to [Fe/H] = -0.27 +/- 0.07 (s.d.) and [Fe/H] = -0.27 +/- 0.06 (s.d.), respectively. Li abundances are derived for 145 probable single-star members, 44 being upper limits. Among turnoff stars outside the Li-dip, A(Li) = 3.04 +/- 0.16 (s.d.), with no trend with color, luminosity, or rotation speed. Evolving from the turnoff across the subgiant branch, there is a well-delineated decline to A(Li) ~1.25 at the giant branch base, coupled with the rotational spindown from between ~20 and 70 km/s to less than 20 km/s for stars entering the subgiant branch and beyond. A(Li) remains effectively constant from the giant branch base to the red giant clump level. A new member above the clump redefines the path of the first-ascent red giant branch; its Li is 0.6 dex below the first-ascent red giants. With one exception, all post-He-flash stars have upper limits to A(Li), at or below the level of the brightest first-ascent red giant. The patterns are in excellent qualitative agreement with the model predictions for low/intermediate-mass stars which undergo rotation-induced mixing at the turnoff and subgiant branch, first dredge-up, and thermohaline mixing beyond the red giant bump.

2017-05-01,1,"On the existence of young embedded clusters at high Galactic latitude Careful analyses of photometric and star count data available for the nine putative young clusters identified by Camargo et al. (2015, 2016) at high Galactic latitudes reveal that none of the groups contain early-type stars, and most are not significant density enhancements above field level. 2MASS colours for stars in the groups match those of unreddened late-type dwarfs and giants, as expected for contamination by (mostly) thin disk objects. A simulation of one such field using only typical high latitude foreground stars yields a colour-magnitude diagram that is very similar to those constructed by Camargo et al. (2015, 2016) as evidence for their young groups as well as the means of deriving their reddenings and distances. Although some of the fields are coincident with clusters of galaxies, one must conclude that there is no evidence that the putative clusters are extremely young stellar groups."
2016-11-11,1,"Properties of Star Clusters -- III: Analysis of 13 FSR Clusters using UKIDSS-GPS and VISTA-VVV Discerning the nature of open cluster candidates is essential for both individual and statistical analyses of cluster properties. Here we establish the nature of thirteen cluster candidates from the FSR cluster list using photometry from the 2MASS and deeper, higher resolution UKIDSS-GPS and VISTA-VVV surveys. These clusters were selected because they were flagged in our previous studies as expected to contain a large proportion of pre-main sequence members or are at unusually small/large Galactocentric distances. We employ a decontamination procedure of JHK photometry to identify cluster members. Cluster properties are homogeneously determined and we conduct a cross comparative study of our results with the literature (where available). Seven of the here studied clusters were confirmed to contain PMS stars, one of which is a newly confirmed cluster. Our study of FSR1716 is the deepest to date and is in notable disagreement with previous studies, finding that it has a distance of about 7.3kpc and age of 10-12Gyr. As such, we argue that this cluster is a potential globular cluster candidate."
2016-11-14,1,"The radial distributions of the two main-sequence components in the young massive star cluster NGC 1856 The recent discovery of double main sequences in the young, massive star cluster NGC 1856 has caught significant attention. The observations can be explained by invoking two stellar generations with different ages and metallicities or by a single generation of stars composed of two populations characterized by different rotation rates. We analyzed the number ratios of stars belonging to both main-sequence components in NGC 1856 as a function of radius. We found that their number ratios remain approximately unchanged from the cluster's central region to its periphery, indicating that both components are homogeneously distributed in space. Through a comparison of the loci of the best-fitting isochrones with the ridge lines of both stellar components, we found that both multiple stellar populations and rapid stellar rotation can potentially explain the observed main-sequence bifurcation in NGC 1856. However, if NGC1856 were a young representative of the old globular clusters, then the multiple stellar populations model would not be able to explain the observed homogeneity in the spatial distributions of these two components, since all relevant scenarios would predict that the second stellar generation should be formed in a more compact configuration than that of the first stellar generation, while NGC 1856 is too young for both stellar generations to have been fully mixed dynamically. We speculate that the rapid stellar rotation scenario would be the favored explanation of the observed multiple stellar sequences in NGC 1856."
2016-11-15,1,"Spectroscopic evidence of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters Galactic globular clusters are not simple stellar populations. And nothing is simple in their study, basically because we try to reconstruct chains of events that occurred at redshift z > 2-3 by observing these objects at z=0, after a Hubble time. Fortunately, spectroscopy offers a magnifying lens: differences of tens or hundreds of Myrs between stellar generations are translated into differences in abundances up to a full dex. I will review the complex pattern emerging by the combined efforts of different groups, focusing on the chemical signatures of multiple populations in globular clusters."
2016-11-17,1,"A Chemical Composition Survey of the Iron-Complex Globular Cluster NGC 6273 (M 19) Recent observations have shown that a growing number of the most massive Galactic globular clusters contain multiple populations of stars with different [Fe/H] and neutron-capture element abundances. NGC 6273 has only recently been recognized as a member of this ""iron-complex"" cluster class, and we provide here a chemical and kinematic analysis of > 300 red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) member stars using high resolution spectra obtained with the Magellan-M2FS and VLT-FLAMES instruments. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that NGC 6273 possesses an intrinsic metallicity spread that ranges from about [Fe/H] = -2 to -1 dex, and may include at least three populations with different [Fe/H] values. The three populations identified here contain separate first (Na/Al-poor) and second (Na/Al-rich) generation stars, but a Mg-Al anti-correlation may only be present in stars with [Fe/H] > -1.65. The strong correlation between [La/Eu] and [Fe/H] suggests that the s-process must have dominated the heavy element enrichment at higher metallicities. A small group of stars with low [alpha/Fe] is identified and may have been accreted from a former surrounding field star population. The cluster's large abundance variations are coupled with a complex, extended, and multimodal blue horizontal branch (HB). The HB morphology and chemical abundances suggest that NGC 6273 may have an origin that is similar to omega Cen and M 54."
2016-11-17,1,"Stellar Mass Segregation in the Aged Galactic Open Star Cluster Berkeley 17 We present the analysis of the morphology of Berkeley\,17, the oldest known open cluster ($\sim10$ Gyr), using a probabilistic star counting of Pan-STARRS point sources, and confirm its core-tail shape, plus an antitail, previously detected with 2MASS data. The stellar population, as diagnosed by the color-magnitude diagram and theoretical isochrones, shows more massive than lower-mass members in the cluster core, whereas there is a paucity of massive members in both tails. This manifests mass segregation in this aged star cluster with the low-mass members being stripped away from the system. It has been claimed that Berkeley 17 is associated with an excessive number of blue stragglers. Our analysis in comparison of the cluster with nearby reference fields indicates that about half of the blue stragglers may be field contaminations, and some may be confused with the rare blue horizontal-branch stars in this cluster."
2014-09,1,"Open clusters: probes of galaxy evolution and bench tests of stellar models Open clusters are the only example of single-age, single initial chemical composition populations in the Galaxy, and they play an important role in the study of the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk. In addition, they have been traditionally employed to test theoretical stellar evolution models. A brief review of constraints/tests of white dwarf models/progenitors, and rotating star models based on Galactic open clusters' observations is presented, introducing also recent contributions of asteroseismic analyses."
2016-05-19,1,"Combining Density and Overlap (CoDO): A New Method for Assessing the Significance of Overlap Among Subgraphs Algorithms for detecting clusters (including overlapping clusters) in graphs have received significant attention in the research community. A closely related important aspect of the problem -- quantification of statistical significance of overlap of clusters, remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents the first theoretical and practical results on quantifying statistically significant interactions between clusters in networks. Such problems commonly arise in diverse applications, ranging from social network analysis to systems biology. The paper addresses the problem of quantifying the statistical significance of the observed overlap of the two clusters in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph model. The analytical framework presented in the paper assigns a $p$-value to overlapping subgraphs by combining information about both the sizes of the subgraphs and their edge densities in comparison to the corresponding values for their overlapping component. This $p$-value is demonstrated to have excellent discrimination properties in real applications and is shown to be robust across broad parameter ranges. Our results are comprehensively validated on synthetic, social, and biological networks. We show that our framework: (i) derives insight from both the density and the size of overlap among communities (circles/pathways), (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods over all tested datasets, and (iii) when compared to other measures, has much broader application scope. In the context of social networks, we identify highly interdependent (social) circles and show that our predictions are highly co-enriched with known user features. In networks of biomolecular interactions, we show that our method identifies novel cross-talk between pathways, sheds light on their mechanisms of interaction, and provides new opportunities for investigations of biomolecular interactions."
2016-09-14,1,"Stellar clusterings around ""Isolated"" Massive YSOs in the LMC Observations suggest that there is a significant fraction of O-stars in the field of the Milky Way that appear to have formed in isolation or in low mass clusters ($<$100 $M_\odot$). The existence of these high-mass stars that apparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm, which requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to understand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is necessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming. With the $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$, we observe the seven most isolated massive ($>$8 $M_\odot$) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other MYSOs, OB associations, and even from known giant molecular clouds, they are actually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals $\sim$100 to several hundred pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously undetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in most cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions. Contrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations suggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses less than 100 $M_\odot$. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for isolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with random sampling of the IMF. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we find evidence that isolated clusters containing O-stars can exist, which in itself is rare."
2014-10-30,1,"Pre-main-sequence isochrones -- III. The Cluster Collaboration isochrone server We present an isochrone server for semi-empirical pre-main-sequence model isochrones in the following systems: Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two-Micron All-Sky Survey, Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Wide-Field Camera, and INT Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS)/UV-Excess Survey (UVEX). The server can be accessed via the Cluster Collaboration webpage {http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/isochrones/}. To achieve this we have used the observed colours of member stars in young clusters with well-established age, distance and reddening to create fiducial loci in the colour-magnitude diagram. These empirical sequences have been used to quantify the discrepancy between the models and data arising from uncertainties in both the interior and atmospheric models, resulting in tables of semi-empirical bolometric corrections (BCs) in the various photometric systems. The model isochrones made available through the server are based on existing stellar interior models coupled with our newly derived semi-empirical BCs. As part of this analysis we also present new cluster parameters for both the Pleiades and Praesepe, yielding ages of $135^{+20}_{-11}$ and $665^{+14}_{-7}\,\rm{Myr}$ as well as distances of $132 \pm 2$ and $184 \pm 2\,\rm{pc}$ respectively (statistical uncertainty only)."
2015-09-01,1,"A uvbyCaHbeta CCD Analysis of the Open Cluster Standard, NGC 752 Precision uvbyCaHbeta photometry of the nearby old open cluster, NGC 752, is presented. The mosaic of CCD fields covers an area ~42' on a side with internal precision at the 0.005 to 0.010 mag level for the majority of stars down to V~15. The CCD photometry is tied to the standard system using an extensive set of published photoelectric observations adopted as secondary standards within the cluster. Multicolor indices are used to eliminate as nonmembers a large fraction of the low probability proper-motion members near the faint end of the main sequence, while identifying 24 potential dwarf members between V=15.0 and 16.5, eight of which have been noted before from Vilnius photometry. From 68 highly probable F dwarf members, we derive a reddening estimate of E(b-y)= 0.025 +/- 0.003 (E(B-V) = 0.034 +/- 0.004), where the error includes the internal photometric uncertainty and the systematic error arising from the choice of the standard (b-y), Hbeta relation. With reddening fixed, [Fe/H] is derived from the F dwarf members using both m_1 and hk, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.071 +/-0.014 (sem) and -0.017 +/- 0.008 (sem), respectively. Taking the internal precision and possible systematics in the standard relations into account, [Fe/H] for NGC 752 becomes -0.03 +/-0.02. With the reddening and metallicity defined, we use the Victoria-Regina isochrones on the Stromgren system and find an excellent match for (m-M) = 8.30 +/- 0.05 and an age of 1.45 +/- 0.05 Gyr at the appropriate metallicity."
2015-09-15,1,"The Arches Cluster: Extended Structure and Tidal Radius At a projected distance of ~26 pc from Sgr A*, the Arches cluster provides insight to star formation in the extreme Galactic Center (GC) environment. Despite its importance, many key properties such as the cluster's internal structure and orbital history are not well known. We present an astrometric and photometric study of the outer region of the Arches cluster (R > 6.25"") using HST WFC3IR. Using proper motions we calculate membership probabilities for stars down to F153M = 20 mag (~2.5 M_sun) over a 120"" x 120"" field of view, an area 144 times larger than previous astrometric studies of the cluster. We construct the radial profile of the Arches to a radius of 75"" (~3 pc at 8 kpc), which can be well described by a single power law. From this profile we place a 3-sigma lower limit of 2.8 pc on the observed tidal radius, which is larger than the predicted tidal radius (1 - 2.5 pc). Evidence of mass segregation is observed throughout the cluster and no tidal tail structures are apparent along the orbital path. The absence of breaks in the profile suggests that the Arches has not likely experienced its closest approach to the GC between ~0.2 - 1 Myr ago. If accurate, this constraint indicates that the cluster is on a prograde orbit and is located front of the sky plane that intersects Sgr A*. However, further simulations of clusters in the GC potential are required to interpret the observed profile with more confidence."
2015-10-14,1,"Implications for the Formation of Blue Straggler Stars from HST Ultraviolet Observations of NGC 188 We present results of a Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey searching for white dwarf (WD) companions to blue straggler stars (BSSs) in open cluster NGC 188. The majority of NGC 188 BSSs (15 of 21) are single-lined binaries with properties suggestive of mass-transfer formation via Roche lobe overflow, specifically through an asymptotic giant branch star transferring mass to a main sequence secondary, yielding a BSS binary with a WD companion. In NGC 188, a BSS formed by this mechanism within the past 400 Myr will have a WD companion hot and luminous enough to be directly detected as a FUV photometric excess with HST. Comparing expected BSS FUV emission to observed photometry reveals four BSSs with WD companions above 12,000 K (younger than 250 Myr) and three WD companions with temperatures between 11,000-12,000 K. These BSS+WD binaries all formed through recent mass transfer. The location of the young BSSs in an optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) indicates that distance from the zero-age main sequence does not necessarily correlate with BSS age. There is no clear CMD separation between mass transfer-formed BSSs and those likely formed through other mechanisms, such as collisions. The seven detected WD companions place a lower limit on the mass-transfer formation frequency of 33%. We consider other possible formation mechanisms by comparing properties of the BSS population to theoretical predictions. We conclude that 14 BSS binaries likely formed from mass transfer, resulting in an inferred mass-transfer formation frequency of approximately 67%."
2015-10-21,1,"Detailed Chemical Abundances in NGC 5824: Another Metal-Poor Globular Cluster with Internal Heavy Element Abundance Variations We present radial velocities, stellar parameters, and detailed abundances of 39 elements derived from high-resolution spectroscopic observations of red giant stars in the luminous, metal-poor globular cluster NGC 5824. We observe 26 stars in NGC 5824 using the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) and two stars using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph. We derive a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.94+/-0.02 (statistical) +/-0.10 (systematic). The metallicity dispersion of this sample of stars, 0.08 dex, is in agreement with previous work and does not exceed the expected observational errors. Previous work suggested an internal metallicity spread only when fainter samples of stars were considered, so we cannot exclude the possibility of an intrinsic metallicity dispersion in NGC 5824. The M2FS spectra reveal a large internal dispersion in [Mg/Fe], 0.28 dex, which is found in a few other luminous, metal-poor clusters. [Mg/Fe] is correlated with [O/Fe] and anti-correlated with [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe]. There is no evidence for internal dispersion among the other alpha- or Fe-group abundance ratios. Twenty-five of the 26 stars exhibit a n-capture enrichment pattern dominated by r-process nucleosynthesis ([Eu/Fe]=+0.11+/-0.12; [Ba/Eu]=-0.66+/-0.05). Only one star shows evidence of substantial s-process enhancement ([Ba/Fe]=+0.56+/-0.12; [Ba/Eu]=+0.38+/-0.14), but this star does not exhibit other characteristics associated with s-process enhancement via mass-transfer from a binary companion. The Pb and other heavy elements produced by the s-process suggest a timescale of no more than a few hundred Myr for star formation and chemical enrichment, like the complex globular clusters M2, M22, and NGC 5286."
2015-10-22,1,"The chemical homogeneity of open clusters Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: <0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, <~0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, <~0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and <~0.03 (0.05) dex for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68% and 95% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within <~6 Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging."
2015-10-27,1,"Properties of the open cluster Tombaugh 1 from high resolution spectroscopy and uvbyCaH$\beta$ photometry Open clusters can be the key to deepen our knowledge on various issues involving the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk and details of stellar evolution because a cluster's properties are applicable to all its members. However the number of open clusters with detailed analysis from high resolution spectroscopy and/or precision photometry imposes severe limitation on studies of these objects. To expand the number of open clusters with well-defined chemical abundances and fundamental parameters, we investigate the poorly studied, anticenter open cluster Tombaugh 1. Using precision uvbyCaH$\beta$ photometry and high resolution spectroscopy, we derive the cluster's properties and, for the first time, present detailed abundance analysis of 10 potential cluster stars. Using radial position from the cluster center and multiple color indices, we have isolated a sample of unevolved probable, single-star members of Tombaugh 1. The weighted photometric metallicity from $m_1$ and $hk$ is [Fe/H] = -0.10 $\pm$ 0.02, while a match to the Victoria-Regina Str\""{o}mgren isochrones leads to an age of 0.95 $\pm$ 0.10 Gyr and an apparent modulus of $(m-M)$ = 13.10 $\pm$ 0.10. Radial velocities identify 6 giants as probable cluster members and the elemental abundances of Fe, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Y,Ba, Ce, and Nd have been derived for both the cluster and the field stars. Tombaugh 1 appears to be a typical inner thin disk, intermediate-age open cluster of slightly subsolar metallicity, located just beyond the solar circle, with solar elemental abundance ratios except for the heavy s-process elements, which are a factor of two above solar. Its metallicity is consistent with a steep metallicity gradient in the galactocentric region between 9.5 and 12 kpc. Our study also shows that Cepheid XZ CMa is not a member of Tombaugh 1, and reveals that this Cepheid presents signs of barium enrichment."
2015-11,1,"A color-period diagram for the open cluster M 48 (NGC 2548), and its rotational age Rotation periods are increasingly being used to derive ages for cool single field stars. Such ages are based on an empirical understanding of how cool stars spin down, acquired by constructing color-period diagrams (CPDs) for a series of open clusters. Our main aims here are to construct a CPD for M 48, to compare this with other clusters of similar age to check for consistency, and to derive a rotational age for M 48 using gyrochronology. We monitored M 48 photometrically for over 2 months with AIP's STELLA I 1.2 m telescope and the WiFSIP 4K imager in Tenerife. Light curves with 3 mmag precision for bright (V~14 mag) stars were produced and then analysed to provide rotation periods. A cluster CPD has then been constructed. We report 62 rotation periods for cool stars in M 48. The CPD displays a clear slow/I-sequence of rotating stars, similar to those seen in the 625 Myr-old Hyades and 590 Myr-old Praesepe clusters, and below both, confirming that M 48 is younger. A similar comparison with the 250 Myr-old M 34 cluster shows that M 48 is older and does not possess any fast/C-sequence G or early K stars like those in M 34, although relatively fast rotators do seem to be present among the late-K and M stars. A more detailed comparison of the CPD with rotational evolution models shows that the cluster stars have a mean age of 450 Myr, and its (rotating) stars can be individually dated to +-117 Myr (26%). Much of this uncertainty stems from intrinsic astrophysical spread in initial periods, and almost all stars are consistent with a single age of 450 Myr. The gyro-age of M 48 as a whole is 450+-50 Myr, in agreement with the previously determined isochrone age of 400+-100 Myr."
2014-12-10,1,"The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories survey (OCCASO) We present the motivation, design and current status of the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories survey (OCCASO). Using the high resolution spectroscopic facilities available at Spanish observatories, OCCASO will derive chemical abundances in a sample of 20 to 25 open clusters older than 0.5 Gyr. This sample will be used to study in detail the formation and evolution of the Galactic disc using open clusters as tracers."
2016-09-27,1,"Learning about stars from their colors We pose the question of how much information on the atmospheric parameters of late-type stars can be retrieved purely from photometric information using standard photometric systems. We carried out numerical experiments using stellar fluxes from model atmospheres, injecting random noise before analyzing them. We examined the presence of degeneracies among atmospheric parameters, and evaluated how well the parameters are extracted depending on the number and wavelength span of the photometric filters available, from the UV GALEX to the mid-IR WISE passbands. We also considered spectrophotometry from the Gaia mission. We find that stellar effective temperatures can be determined accurately ($\sigma \sim$ 0.01 dex or about 150 K) when reddening is negligible or known, based merely on optical photometry, and the accuracy can be improved twofold by including IR data. On the other hand, stellar metallicities and surface gravities are fairly unconstrained from optical or IR photometryy. However, our ability to retrieve these parameters can improve twofold by adding UV photometry. When reddening is considered a free parameter, assuming it can be modeled perfectly, our experiments suggest that it can be disentangled from the rest of the parameters. This theoretical study indicates that combining broad-band photometry from the UV to the mid-IR allows atmospheric parameters and interstellar extinction to be determined with fair accuracy. The use of UV passbands helps substantially to derive metallicities and surface gravities, as well as to break the degeneracy between effective temperature and reddening. The Gaia BP/RP data can disentangle all the parameters, provided the stellar SEDs are modeled reasonably well."
2016-05-26,1,"Massive stars reveal variations of the stellar initial mass function in the Milky Way stellar clusters We investigate whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal, or whether there are significant cluster-to-cluster variations of the IMF among young stellar clusters in the Milky Way. We propose a method to uncover the range of variation of the parameters that describe the IMF for the population of young clusters in the Milky Way. The method relies exclusively on the high mass content of the clusters, but is able to yield information on the distributions of parameters of the IMF over the entire stellar mass range. This is achieved by appropriately comparing the fractions of single and lonely massive O stars in a recent catalog of the Milky Way clusters with a large library of simulated clusters built with various distribution functions of the IMF parameters. The masses of synthetic clusters are randomly drawn using a power-law distributions function, while stellar masses in the clusters are randomly drawn using a tapered power-law function. The synthetic clusters are further corrected for the effects of binary population, stellar evolution, sample incompleteness, and estimates are made for the effects of ejected O stars. Our findings indicate that broad distributions of the IMF parameters are required in order to reproduce the fractions of single and lonely O stars in the Milky Way clusters and they do not lend support to the existence of a cluster mass-maximum stellar mass relation. We propose a probabilistic formulation of the IMF based on the distribution functions of its parameters."
2015-08-06,1,"A comparative study on the reliability of open cluster parameters Open clusters are known as excellent tracers of the structure and chemical evolution of the Galactic disk, however, the accuracy and reliability of open cluster parameters is poorly known. In recent years, several studies aimed to present homogeneous open cluster parameter compilations, which are based on some different approaches and photometric data. These catalogues are excellent sources to facilitate testing of the actual accuracy of open cluster parameters. We compare seven cluster parameter compilations statistically and with an external sample, which comprises the mean results of individual studies. Furthermore, we selected the objects IC 4651, NGC 2158, NGC 2383, NGC 2489, NGC 2627, NGC 6603, and Trumpler 14, with the main aim to highlight differences in the fitting solutions. We derived correction terms for each cluster parameter, using the external calibration sample. Most results by the compilations are reasonable scaled, but there are trends or constant offsets of different degree. We also identified one data set, which appears too erroneous to allow adjustments. After the correction, the mean intrinsic errors amount to about 0.2 dex for the age, 0.08 mag for the reddening, and 0.35 mag for the distance modulus. However, there is no study that characterises the cluster morphologies of all test cases in a correct and consistent manner. Furthermore, we found that the largest compilations probably include at least 20 percent of problematic objects, for which the parameters differ significantly. These could be among others doubtful or unlikely open clusters that do not facilitate an unambiguous fitting solution."
2016-04-01,1,"Low-metallicity Young Clusters in the Outer Galaxy. II. Sh 2-208 We obtained deep near-infrared images of Sh 2-208, one of the lowest-metallicity HII regions in the Galaxy, [O/H] = -0.8 dex. We detected a young cluster in the center of the HII region with a limiting magnitude of K = 18.0 mag (10sigma), which corresponds to a mass detection limit of ~0.2 M_sun. This enables the comparison of star-forming properties under low metallicity with those of the solar neighborhood. We identified 89 cluster members. From the fitting of the K-band luminosity function (KLF), the age and distance of the cluster are estimated to be ~0.5 Myr and ~4 kpc, respectively. The estimated young age is consistent with the detection of strong CO emission in the cluster region and the estimated large extinction of cluster members (Av ~ 4--25 mag). The observed KLF suggests that the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the low-metallicity cluster is not significantly different from canonical IMFs in the solar neighborhood in terms of both high-mass slope and IMF peak (characteristic mass). Despite the very young age, the disk fraction of the cluster is estimated at only 27pm6 %, which is significantly lower than those in the solar metallicity. Those results are similar to Sh 2-207, which is another low-metallicity star-forming region close to Sh 2-208 with a separation of 12 pc,suggesting that their star-forming activities in low-metallicity environments are essentially identical to those in the solar neighborhood, except for the disk dispersal timescale. From large-scale mid-infrared images, we suggest that sequential star formation is taking place in Sh 2-207, Sh 2-208 and the surrounding region, triggered by an expanding bubble with a ~30 pc radius."
2015-11-10,1,"Star cluster formation with stellar feedback and large-scale inflow During star cluster formation, ongoing mass accretion is resisted by stellar feedback in the form of protostellar outflows from the low-mass stars and photo-ionization and radiation pressure feedback from the massive stars. We model the evolution of cluster-forming regions during a phase in which both accretion and feedback are present, and use these models to investigate how star cluster formation might terminate. Protostellar outflows are the strongest form of feedback in low-mass regions, but these cannot stop cluster formation if matter continues to flow in. In more massive clusters, radiation pressure and photo-ionization rapidly clear the cluster-forming gas when its column density is too small. We assess the rates of dynamical mass ejection and of evaporation, while accounting for the important effect of dust opacity on photo-ionization. Our models are consistent with the census of protostellar outflows in NGC 1333 and Serpens South, and with the dust temperatures observed in regions of massive star formation. Comparing observations of massive cluster-forming regions against our model parameter space, and against our expectations for accretion-driven evolution, we infer that massive-star feedback is a likely cause of gas disruption in regions with velocity dispersions less than a few kilometers per second, but that more massive and more turbulent regions are too strongly bound for stellar feedback to be disruptive."
2015-11-19,1,"GeMs/GSAOI observations of La Serena 94: an old and far open cluster inside the solar circle Physical properties were derived for the candidate open cluster La Serena 94, recently unveiled by the VVV collaboration. Thanks to the exquisite angular resolution provided by GeMS/GSAOI, we could characterize this system in detail, for the first time, with deep photometry in JHK$_{s}$ - bands. Decontaminated JHK$_{s}$ diagrams reach about 5 mag below the cluster turnoff in H. The locus of red clump giants in the colour - colour diagram, together with an extinction law, was used to obtain an average extinction of $A_V =14.18 \pm 0.71$. The same stars were considered as standard - candles to derive the cluster distance, $8.5 \pm 1.0$ kpc. Isochrones were matched to the cluster colour - magnitude diagrams to determine its age, $\log{t(yr)}=9.12\pm 0.06$, and metallicity, $Z=0.02\pm0.01$. A core radius of $r_{c}=0.51\pm 0.04$ pc was found by fitting King models to the radial density profile. By adding up the visible stellar mass to an extrapolated mass function, the cluster mass was estimated as $M=(2.65\pm0.57) \times 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$, consistent with an integrated magnitude of $M_{K}=-5.82\pm0.16$ and a tidal radius of $r_{t}=17.2\pm2.1$ pc. The overall characteristics of La Serena 94 confirm that it is an old open cluster located in the Crux spiral arm towards the fourth Galactic quadrant and distant $7.30\pm 0.49$ kpc from the Galactic centre. The cluster distorted structure, mass segregation and age indicate that it is a dynamically evolved stellar system."
2016-11-08,1,"Globular Cluster Abundances from High-Resolution, Integrated-Light Spectroscopy. II. Expanding the Metallicity Range for Old Clusters and Updated Analysis Techniques We present abundances of globular clusters in the Milky Way and Fornax from integrated light spectra. Our goal is to evaluate the consistency of the integrated light analysis relative to standard abundance analysis for individual stars in those same clusters. This sample includes an updated analysis of 7 clusters from our previous publications and results for 5 new clusters that expand the metallicity range over which our technique has been tested. We find that the [Fe/H] measured from integrated light spectra agrees to $\sim$0.1 dex for globular clusters with metallicities as high as [Fe/H]=$-0.3$, but the abundances measured for more metal rich clusters may be underestimated. In addition we systematically evaluate the accuracy of abundance ratios, [X/Fe], for Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I, Cu I, Y II, Zr I, Ba II, La II, Nd II, and Eu II. The elements for which the integrated light analysis gives results that are most similar to analysis of individual stellar spectra are Fe I, Ca I, Si I, Ni I, and Ba II. The elements that show the greatest differences include Mg I and Zr I. Some elements show good agreement only over a limited range in metallicity. More stellar abundance data in these clusters would enable more complete evaluation of the integrated light results for other important elements."
2016-11-09,1,"APOGEE Chemical Abundances of Globular Cluster Giants in the Inner Galaxy We report chemical abundances obtained by SDSS-III/APOGEE for giant stars in five globular clusters located within 2.2 kpc of the Galactic centre. We detect the presence of multiple stellar populations in four of those clusters (NGC 6553, NGC 6528, Terzan 5, and Palomar 6) and find strong evidence for their presence in NGC 6522. All clusters present a significant spread in the abundances of N, C, Na, and Al, with the usual correlations and anti-correlations between various abundances seen in other globular clusters. Our results provide important quantitative constraints on theoretical models for self-enrichment of globular clusters, by testing their predictions for the dependence of yields of elements such as Na, N, C, and Al on metallicity. They also confirm that, under the assumption that field N-rich stars originate from globular cluster destruction, they can be used as tracers of their parental systems in the high- metallicity regime."
2016-11-09,1,"Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution parallaxes and proper motions for 5 Galactic globular clusters We perform a systematic search for Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue that formed part of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1), and identify 5 members of NGC104 (47 Tucanae), 1 member of NGC5272 (M3), 5 members of NGC6121 (M4), 7 members of NGC6397, and 2 members of NGC6656 (M22). By taking a weighted average of the member stars, fully accounting for the correlations between parameter estimates, we estimate the parallax (and, hence, distance) and proper motion (PM) of the GCs. This provides a homogeneous PM study of multiple GCs based on an astrometric catalog with small and well-controlled systematic errors, and yields random PM errors that are similar to existing measurements. Detailed comparison to the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements generally shows excellent agreement, validating the astrometric quality of both TGAS and HST. By contrast, comparison to ground-based measurements shows that some of those must have systematic errors exceeding the random errors. Our parallax estimates have uncertainties an order of magnitude larger than previous studies, but nevertheless imply distances consistent with previous estimates. By combining our PM measurements with literature positions, distances and radial velocities, we measure Galactocentric space motions for the clusters and find that these are also in good agreement with previous orbital analyses. Our results highlight the future promise of Gaia for the determining accurate distances and PMs of Galactic GCs, which will provide crucial constraints on the near end of the cosmic distance ladder, and provide accurate GC orbital histories."
2015-11-25,1,"The Lifecycle of Clusters in Galaxies We review many of the basic properties of star cluster systems, and focus in particular on how they relate to their host galaxy properties and ambient environment. The cluster mass and luminosity functions are well approximated by power-laws of the form $Ndm \propto M^{\alpha}dm$, with $\alpha\sim-2$ over most of the observable range. However, there is now clear evidence that both become steeper at high masses/luminosities, with the value of the downward turn dependent on environment. The host galaxy properties also appear to affect the cluster formation efficiency ($\Gamma$ - i.e., the fraction of stars that form in bound clusters), with higher star-formation rate density galaxies having higher $\Gamma$ values. Within individual galaxies, there is evidence for $\Gamma$ to vary by a factor of 3-4, likely following the molecular gas surface density, in agreement with recent predictions. Finally, we discuss cluster disruption and its effect on the observed properties of a population, focussing on the age distribution of clusters. We briefly discuss the expectations of theoretical and numerical studies, and also the observed distributions in a number of galaxies. Most observational studies now find agreement with theoretical expectations, namely nearly a constant cluster age distribution for ages up to ~100 Myr (i.e. little disruption), and a drastic steepening above this value caused by a combination of cluster disruption and incompleteness. Rapid cluster disruption for clusters with ages < 100 Myr is ruled out for most galaxies."
2016-03-16,1,"Constraining Globular Cluster Age Uncertainties Using the IR Color-Magnitude Diagram Globular Clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way are the primary laboratories for establishing the ages of the oldest stellar populations and for measuring the color-magnitude relation of stars. In infrared (IR) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), the stellar main sequence (MS) exhibits a ""kink"", due to opacity effects in M dwarfs, such that lower mass and cooler dwarfs become bluer in the IR color baseline. This diagnostic offers a new opportunity to model GC CMDs and to reduce uncertainties on cluster properties (e.g., their derived ages). In this context, we analyzed Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 IR archival observations of four GCs - 47Tuc, M4, NGC2808, and NGC6752 - for which the data are deep enough to fully sample the low-mass MS, reaching at least ~ 2 mag below the ""kink"". We derived the fiducial lines for each cluster and compared them with a grid of isochrones over a large range of parameter space, allowing age, metallicity, distance, and reddening to vary within reasonable selected ranges. The derived ages for the four clusters are respectively 11.6, 11.5, 11.2, and 12.1 Gyr and their random uncertainties are \sigma ~ 0.7 - 1.1 Gyr. Our results suggest that the near-IR MS ""kink"", combined with the MS turn-off, provides a valuable tool to measure GC ages and offers a promising opportunity to push the absolute age of GCs to sub-Gyr accuracy with the next generation IR telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope."
2015-11-27,1,"Theory of stellar convection II: first stellar models We present here the first stellar models on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), in which convection is treated according to the novel scale-free convection theory (SFC theory) by Pasetto et al. (2014). The aim is to compare the results of the new theory with those from the classical, calibrated mixing-length (ML) theory to examine differences and similarities. We integrate the equations describing the structure of the atmosphere from the stellar surface down to a few percent of the stellar mass using both ML theory and SFC theory. The key temperature over pressure gradients, the energy fluxes, and the extension of the convective zones are compared in both theories. The analysis is first made for the Sun and then extended to other stars of different mass and evolutionary stage. The results are adequate: the SFC theory yields convective zones, temperature gradients of the ambient and of the convective element, and energy fluxes that are very similar to those derived from the ""calibrated"" MT theory for main sequence stars. We conclude that the old scale dependent ML theory can now be replaced with a self-consistent scale-free theory able to predict correct results, one which is simpler and more physically grounded than the ML theory. Fundamentally, the SFC theory offers a deeper insight of the underlying physics than numerical simulations."
2015-11-30,1,"The formation and dynamical evolution of young star clusters Recent observations have revealed a variety of young star clusters, including embedded systems, young massive clusters, and associations. We study the formation and dynamical evolution of these clusters using a combination of simulations and theoretical models. Our simulations start with a turbulent molecular cloud that collapses under its own gravity. The stars are assumed to form in the densest regions in the collapsing cloud after an initial free-fall times of the molecular cloud. The dynamical evolution of these stellar distributions are continued by means of direct $N$-body simulations. The molecular clouds typical for the Milky Way Galaxy tend to form embedded clusters which evolve to resemble open clusters. The associations were initially considerably more clumpy, but lost their irregularity in about a dynamical time scale due to the relaxation process. The densest molecular clouds, which are absent in the Milky Way but are typical in starburst galaxies, form massive young star clusters. They indeed are rare in the Milky Way. Our models indicate a distinct evolutionary path from molecular clouds to open clusters and associations or to massive star clusters. The mass-radius relation for both types of evolutionary tracks excellently matches the observations. According to our calculations the time evolution of the half-mass radius for open clusters and associations follows $r_{\rm h}/{\rm pc}=2.7(t_{\rm age}/{\rm pc})^{2/3}$, whereas for massive star clusters $r_{\rm h}/{\rm pc}=0.34(t_{\rm age}/{\rm Myr})^{2/3}$. Both trends are consistent with the observed age-mass-radius relation for clusters in the Milky Way."
2015-12-02,1,"Dynamical Features of Open Star Cluster: DOLIDZE 14 The radial density profile (RDP) of cluster DOLIDZE 14 provides the radius of 9.8 arcmin, it is based on consideration of first plateau region of RDP. This value is less than the radius which comes through consideration of the second plateau region. The stars, which are inside of the cluster radius, are used to estimate the distance-modulus and E(I-R) by fitting theoretical isochrone on the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The best fitted stellar isochrone of solar matellacity provides these values as 11.15 mag and 0.25 mag, respectively. These results are used to estimate the mass-function slope of the cluster, which comes to be different that of Salpeter-Value. The enhancement of brighter stars does not found within the cluster region which indicates its old age. The Mass-Segregation phenomena of cluster is found between massive and lighter stars but not found in fainter stars, having magnitude greater than 15 mag in I-band. The relaxation-time is very little in the comparison of its age. The mean proper motion of cluster's radial zones is found to be high in the comparison of field region (12.77-15.18 arcmin). This is indicative of weak-gravitational bond among the stars of the cluster."
2016-01-24,1,"Statistical analysis for precise estimation of structural properties of NGC 1960 The statistical analysis of gathered of astronomical objects (such as open cluster) are excellent tools to compute its parameters and to constrain the theory of its evolution. Here, we are represented detailed structural and membership analysis of an open cluster NGC 1960 through various statistical formulas and approaches. King empirical methods provide the information about the cluster extent as 5.2 +/- 0.4 pc. The exact identification of members of cluster is needed to precise estimation of its age, reddening, metallicity etc., therefore, to identify most probable members (MPMs), we adopted the combined approach of various statistical methods (kinematic, photometric and statistical) and 712 members are satisfied needed criteria of MPMs. The basic physical parameters of the cluster such as E(B-V)=0.23+/-0.02 mag, E(V-K)=1.05+/-0.03mag, log(Age)=7.35+/-0.05, and (m-M)=11.35+/-0.10 mag are obtained using the color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. NGC 1960 is found to be located at a distance of 1.34 +/- 0.03 kpc. Using the archival proper motion catalogues, we estimate mean proper motions of NGC 1960 as 0.83+/-0.26 mas yr-1 and -6.55+/-0.23 mas yr-1 in the direction of RA and DEC, respectively."
2016-02-17,1,"Pixel Color Magnitude Diagrams for Semi-Resolved Stellar Populations: The Star Formation History of Regions within the Disk and Bulge of M31 The analysis of stellar populations has, by and large, been developed for two limiting cases: spatially-resolved stellar populations in the color-magnitude diagram, and integrated light observations of distant systems. In between these two extremes lies the semi-resolved regime, which encompasses a rich and relatively unexplored realm of observational phenomena. Here we develop the concept of pixel color magnitude diagrams (pCMDs) as a powerful technique for analyzing stellar populations in the semi-resolved regime. pCMDs show the distribution of imaging data in the plane of pixel luminosity vs. pixel color. A key feature of pCMDs is that they are sensitive to all stars, including both the evolved giants and the unevolved main sequence stars. An important variable in this regime is the mean number of stars per pixel, $N_{\rm pix}$. Simulated pCMDs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the star formation history (SFH) and allow one to break degeneracies between age, metallicity and dust based on two filter data for values of $N_{\rm pix}$ up to at least $10^4$. We extract pCMDs from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of M31 and derive non-parametric SFHs from $10^6$ yr to $10^{10}$ yr for both the crowded disk and bulge regions (where $N_{\rm pix}\approx30-10^3$). From analyzing a small region of the disk we find a non-parametric SFH that is smooth and consistent with an exponential decay timescale of 4 Gyr. The bulge SFH is also smooth and consistent with a 2 Gyr decay timescale. pCMDs will likely play an important role in maximizing the science returns from next generation ground and space-based facilities."
2016-02-23,1,"Abundances and kinematics for ten anticentre open clusters Open clusters are distributed all across the disk and are convenient tracers of its properties. In particular, outer disk clusters bear a key role for the investigation of the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk. The goal of this study is to derive homogeneous elemental abundances for a sample of ten outer disk OCs, and investigate possible links with disk structures such as the Galactic Anticenter Stellar Structure. We analyse high-resolution spectra of red giants, obtained from the HIRES@Keck and UVES@VLT archives. We derive elemental abundances and stellar atmosphere parameters by means of the classical equivalent width method. We also performed orbit integrations using proper motions. The Fe abundances we derive trace a shallow negative radial metallicity gradient of slope -0.027+/-0.007 dex.kpc-1 in the outer 12 kpc of the disk. The [alpha/Fe] gradient appears flat, with a slope of 0.006+/-0.007 dex.kpc-1 . The two outermost clusters (Be 29 and Sau 1) appear to follow elliptical orbits. Be 20 also exhibits a peculiar orbit with a large excursion above the plane. The irregular orbits of the three most metal-poor clusters (of which two are located at the edge of the Galactic disk), if confirmed by more robust astrometric measurements such as those of the Gaia mission, are compatible with an inside-out formation scenario for the Milky Way, in which extragalactic material is accreted onto the outer disk. We cannot determine if Be 20, Be 29,and Sau 1 are of extragalactic origin, as they may be old genuine Galactic clusters whose orbits were perturbed by accretion events or minor mergers in the past 5 Gyr, or they may be representants of the thick disk population. The nature of these objects is intriguing and deserves further investigations in the near future."
2016-03-01,1,"CCD UBV photometry of the open cluster NGC 6819 We present the results of CCD UBV observations of the open cluster NGC 6819. We calculated the stellar density profile in the cluster's field to determine the structural parameters of NGC 6819. Using the existing astrometric data, we calculated the probabilities of the stars being physical members of the cluster, and used these objects in the determination of the astrophysical parameters of NGC 6819. We inferred the reddening and metallicity of the cluster as $E(B-V)=0.130\pm0.035$ mag and $[Fe/H]=+0.051\pm 0.020$ dex, respectively, using the U-B vs B-V two-colour diagram and UV excesses of the F-G type main-sequence stars. We fit the colour-magnitude diagrams of NGC6819 with the PARSEC isochrones and derived the distance modula, distance and age of the cluster as $\mu_{V}=12.22\pm 0.10$ mag, $d=2309\pm106$ pc and $t=2.4\pm0.2$ Gyr, respectively. The parameters of the galactic orbit estimated for NGC 6819 indicate that the cluster is orbiting in a slightly eccentric orbit of $e=0.06$ with a period of $P_{orb}=142$ Myr. The slope of the mass function estimated for the cluster is close to the one found for the stars in the solar neighbourhood."
2016-03-02,1,"The OCCASO survey: Presentation and radial velocities of twelve Milky Way Open Clusters Open clusters (OCs) are crucial for studying the formation and evolution of the Galactic disc. However, the lack of a large number of OCs analyzed homogeneously hampers the investigations about chemical patterns and the existence of Galactocentric radial and vertical gradients, or an age-metallicity relation. To overcome this, we have designed the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories survey (OCCASO). We aim to provide homogeneous radial velocities, physical parameters and individual chemical abundances of six or more Red Clump stars for a sample of 25 old and intermediate-age OCs visible from the Northern hemisphere. To do so, we use high resolution spectroscopic facilities (R> 62,000) available at Spanish observatories. We present the motivation, design and current status of the survey, together with the first data release of radial velocities for 77 stars in 12 OCs, which represents about 50% of the survey. We include clusters never studied with high-resolution spectroscopy before (NGC~1907, NGC~6991, NGC~7762), and clusters in common with other large spectroscopic surveys like the Gaia-ESO Survey (NGC~6705) and APOGEE (NGC~2682 and NGC~6819). We perform internal comparisons between instruments to evaluate and correct internal systematics of the results, and compare our radial velocities with previous determinations in the literature, when available. Finally, radial velocities for each cluster are used to perform a preliminar kinematic study in relation with the Galactic disc."
2016-03-05,1,Improved proper motion determinations for 15 open clusters based on the UCAC4 catalog The proper motions of 15 nearby (d < 1 kpc) open clusters were recalculated using data from the UCAC4 catalog. Only evolved or main sequence stars inside a certain radius from the center of the cluster were used. The results differ significantly from the ones presented by Dias et al. (2014). This could be explained by the different approach to taking the field star contamination into account. The present work aims to emphasize the importance of applying photometric criteria for the calculation of open cluster proper motions.
2015-11-28,1,"On the metallicity of open clusters. III. Homogenised sample Open clusters are known as excellent tools for various topics in Galactic research. For example, they allow accurately tracing the chemical structure of the Galactic disc. However, the metallicity is known only for a rather low percentage of the open cluster population, and these values are based on a variety of methods and data. Therefore, a large and homogeneous sample is highly desirable. In the third part of our series we compile a large sample of homogenised open cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different sources. These data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial metallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models. We used photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The different sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and correlations. In total, metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We used the spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent Galactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce the flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of radial migration is either underestimated in the models, or an additional mechanism is at work. [abridged]"

New Objects in the Outskirts of the Large Magellanic Cloud The Magellanic System (MS), consisting of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Magellanic Bridge (MBR), contains diverse sample of star clusters. Their spatial distribution, ages and chemical abundances may provide important information about the history of formation of the whole System. We use deep photometric maps derived from the images collected during the fourth phase of The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV) to construct the most complete catalog of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud using the homogeneous photometric data. In this paper we present the collection of star clusters found in the area of about 225 square degrees in the outer regions of the LMC. Our sample contains 679 visually identified star cluster candidates, 226 of which were not listed in any of the previously published catalogs. The new clusters are mainly young small open clusters or clusters similar to associations."
2016-09-25,1,"Near-Infrared Photometry of Globular Clusters Towards the Galactic Bulge: Observations and Photometric Metallicity Indicators We present wide field JHKs photometry of 16 Galactic globular clusters located towards the Galactic bulge, calibrated on the 2MASS photometric system. Differential reddening corrections and statistical field star decontamination are employed for all of these clusters before fitting fiducial sequences to the cluster red giant branches (RGBs). Observed values and uncertainties are reported for several photometric features, including the magnitude of the RGB bump, tip, the horizontal branch (HB) and the slope of the upper RGB. The latest spectroscopically determined chemical abundances are used to build distance- and reddening-independent relations between observed photometric features and cluster metallicity, optimizing the sample size and metallicity baseline of these relations by supplementing our sample with results from the literature. We find that the magnitude different between the HB and the RGB bump can be used to predict metallicities, in terms of both iron abundance [Fe/H] and global metallicity [M/H], with a precision of better than 0.1 dex in all three near-IR bandpasses for relative metal-rich ([M/H]$\gtrsim$-1) clusters. Meanwhile, both the slope of the upper RGB and the magnitude difference between the RGB tip and bump are useful metallicity indicators over the entire sampled metallicity range (-2$\lesssim$[M/H]$\lesssim$0) with a precision of 0.2 dex or better, despite model predictions that the RGB slope may become unreliable at high (near-solar) metallicities. Our results agree with previous calibrations in light of the relevant uncertainties, and we discuss implications for clusters with controversial metallicities as well as directions for further investigation."
2015-11-12,1,"The Dynamical Evolution of Star Clusters in the Milky Way We perform $N$-body simulations of star clusters in time-dependant galactic potentials. Since the Milky Way was built-up through mergers with dwarf galaxies, its globular cluster population is made up of clusters formed both during the initial collapse of the Galaxy and in dwarf galaxies that were later accreted. Throughout a dwarf-Milky Way merger, dwarf galaxy clusters are subject to a changing galactic potential. Building on our previous work, we investigate how this changing galactic potential affects the evolution of a cluster's half mass radius. In particular, we simulate clusters on circular orbits around a dwarf galaxy that either falls into the Milky Way or evaporates as it orbits the Milky Way. We find that the dynamical evolution of a star cluster is determined by whichever galaxy has the strongest tidal field at the position of the cluster. Thus, clusters entering the Milky Way undergo changes in size as the Milky Way tidal field becomes stronger and that of the dwarf diminishes. We find that ultimately accreted clusters quickly become the same size as a cluster born in the Milky Way on the same orbit. Assuming their initial sizes are similar, clusters born in the Galaxy and those that are accreted cannot be separated based on their current size alone."
2016-03-07,1,"The effect of unresolved binaries on globular cluster proper-motion dispersion profiles High-precision kinematic studies of globular clusters require an accurate knowledge of all possible sources of contamination. Amongst other sources, binary stars can introduce systematic biases in the kinematics. Using a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations with different concentrations and binary fractions, we investigate the effect of unresolved binaries on proper-motion dispersion profiles, treating the simulations like HST proper-motion samples. Since globular clusters evolve towards a state of partial energy equipartition, more massive stars lose energy and decrease their velocity dispersion. As a consequence, on average, binaries have a lower velocity dispersion, since they are more massive kinematic tracers. We show that, in the case of clusters with high binary fraction (initial binary fraction of 50%) and high concentration (i.e., closer to energy equipartition), unresolved binaries introduce a color-dependent bias in the velocity dispersion of main-sequence stars of the order of 0.1-0.3 km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding to $1-6$% of the velocity dispersion), with the reddest stars having a lower velocity dispersion, due to the higher fraction of contaminating binaries. This bias depends on the ability to distinguish binaries from single stars, on the details of the color-magnitude diagram and the photometric errors. We apply our analysis to the HSTPROMO data set of NGC 7078 (M15) and show that no effect ascribable to binaries is observed, consistent with the low binary fraction of the cluster. Our work indicates that binaries do not significantly bias proper-motion velocity-dispersion profiles, but should be taken into account in the error budget of kinematic analyses."
2015-11-15,1,"Binary Information from Open Clusters Using SEDS (BINOCS) Project: The Dynamical Evolution of the Binary Populations in Cluster Environments Studying the internal dynamics of stellar clusters is conducted primarily through N-Body simulations. One of the major inputs into N-Body simulations is the binary star frequency and mass distribution, which is currently constrained by relations derived from field binary stars. However to truly understand how clustered environments evolve, binary data from within star clusters is needed including masses. Detailed information on binaries masses, primary and secondary, in star clusters has been limited to date. The primary technique currently available has been radial velocity surveys that are limited in depth. Using previous two-band photometry-based studies that may cover different mass ranges produce potentially discrepant interpretations of the observed binary population. We introduce a new binary detection method, Binary INformation from Open Clusters Using SEDs (BINOCS) that covers the wide mass range needed to improve cluster N-body simulation inputs and comparisons. Using newly-observed multi-wavelength photometric catalogs (0.3 - 8 microns) of the key open clusters with a range of ages, we can show that the BINOCS method determines accurate binary component masses for unresolved cluster binaries through comparison to available RV-based studies. Using this method, we present results on the dynamical evolution of binaries from 0.4 - 2.5 solar masses within five prototypical clusters, spaning 30 Myr to 3.5 Gyr, and how the binary populations evolve as a function of mass."
2011-04-01,1,"The usefulness of 2MASS JHKs photometry for open cluster studies 2MASS JHKs data are used to infer the reddening and distance of open clusters for which limited optical data are available. Intrinsic ZAMS color-color and color-magnitude relations are derived with reference to existing calibrations, standard stars, three uniformly-reddened clusters: Stock 16, NGC 2362, and NGC 2281, and unreddened Hyades dwarfs. The method of inferring interstellar reddening and distance for sparsely-populated open clusters is applied to Berkeley 44, Turner 1, and Collinder 419, for which existing results conflict with those inferred from JHKs data. The last two clusters are of special interest: Turner 1 because it hosts the Galaxy's longest-period classical Cepheid, and Collinder 419 because it lies in the Cygnus X complex."

We measured V magnitudes and V-I colours for 2865 stars and T1 magnitudes and C-T1 colours for 1815 stars in an area of 13.6 arcmin × 13.6 arcmin. The comparison of the cluster colour-magnitude diagrams with isochrones of the Geneva group yield E(V-I) = 0.33 ± 0.07 and V-MV = 13.70 ± 0.15 for log t = 8.65 (t = 440 Myr) and Z = 0.008 ([Fe/H] = -0.40), and E(C-T1) = 0.40 ± 0.10 and T1-MT1 = 13.65 ± 0.15 for the same age and metallicity level. The resulting E(V-I) reddening value implies E(B-V) = 0.25 ± 0.05 and a distance from the Sun of (3.8 ± 0.5) kpc. Star counts carried out within and outside the cluster region allowed us to estimate the cluster angular radius as 5.3 arcmin ± 0.3 arcmin (5.9 pc). When using the E(B-V) reddening value here derived and the original Washington photometric data of \citet{gcm91} for the stars confirmed as red cluster giants from Coravel radial velocities, we found [Fe/H] = -0.31 ± 0.04, which is in good agreement with the best fits of isochrones. Therefore, NGC 2324 is found to be a relatively young, metal-poor and distant open cluster located beyond the Perseus spiral arm. A comparison of NGC 2324 with 10 well-known open clusters of nearly the same age shows that the cluster metal abundance and its position in the Galaxy are consistent with the existence of a radial abundance gradient of -0.07 dex kpc-1 in the Galactic disc."
2008-05-01,1,"The old open cluster NGC 2112: updated estimates of fundamental parameters based on a membership analysis† We report on a new, wide-field (20 × 20 arcmin2),  multicolour (UBVI), photometric campaign in the area of the nearby old open cluster NGC 2112. At the same time, we provide medium-resolution spectroscopy of 35 (and high-resolution of additional 5) red giant and turn-off stars. This material is analysed with the aim to update the fundamental parameters of this traditionally difficult cluster, which is very sparse and suffers from heavy field star contamination. Among the 40 stars with spectra, we identified 21 bona fide radial velocity members which allow us to put more solid constraints on the cluster's metal abundance, long suggested to be as low as the metallicity of globulars. As indicated earlier by us on a purely photometric basis, the cluster [Fe/H] abundance is slightly supersolar ([Fe/H] = 0.16 +/- 0.03) and close to the Hyades value, as inferred from a detailed abundance analysis of three of the five stars with higher resolution spectra. Abundance ratios are also marginally supersolar. Based on this result, we revise the properties of NGC 2112 using stellar models from the Padova and Yale-Yonsei groups. For this metal abundance, we find that the cluster's age, reddening and distance values are 1.8 Gyr, 0.60 mag and 940 pc, respectively. Both the Yale-Yonsei and Padova models predict the same values for the fundamental parameters within the errors. Overall, NGC 2112 is a typical solar neighbourhood, thin-disc star cluster, sharing the same chemical properties of F-G stars and open clusters close to the Sun. This investigation outlines the importance of a detailed membership analysis in the study of disc star clusters. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 Magellan Telescopes, located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

2013-11-01,1,"Dynamical modelling of NGC 6809: selecting the best model using Bayesian inference The precise cosmological origin of globular clusters remains uncertain,  a situation hampered by the struggle of observational approaches in conclusively identifying the presence, or not, of dark matter in these systems. In this paper, we address this question through an analysis of the particular case of NGC 6809. While previous studies have performed dynamical modelling of this globular cluster using a small number of available kinematic data, they did not perform appropriate statistical inference tests for the choice of best model description; such statistical inference for model selection is important since, in general, different models can result in significantly different inferred quantities. With the latest kinematic data, we use Bayesian inference tests for model selection and thus obtain the best-fitting models, as well as mass and dynamic mass-to-light ratio estimates. For this, we introduce a new likelihood function that provides more constrained distributions for the defining parameters of dynamical models. Initially, we consider models with a known distribution function, and then model the cluster using solutions of the spherically symmetric Jeans equation; this latter approach depends upon the mass density profile and anisotropy β parameter. In order to find the best description for the cluster we compare these models by calculating their Bayesian evidence. We find smaller mass and dynamic mass-to-light ratio values than previous studies, with the best-fitting Michie model for a constant mass-to-light ratio of Upsilon = 0.90^{+0.14}_{-0.14} and M_{dyn}=6.10^{+0.51}_{-0.88} × 10^4 M_{{⊙}}. We exclude the significant presence of dark matter throughout the cluster, showing that no physically motivated distribution of dark matter can be present away from the cluster core."
2003-12-01,1,"Intermediate-age Galactic open clusters: fundamental parameters of NGC 2627 Charge-coupled device (CCD) photometry in the Johnson V, Kron-Cousins I and Washington CMT1 systems is presented in the field of the poorly known open cluster NGC 2627. Four independent Washington abundance indices yield a mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.12 +/- 0.08, which is compatible with the existence of a radial gradient in the Galactic disc. The resultant colour-magnitude diagrams indicate that the cluster is an intermediate-age object of 1.4 Gyr. Based on the best fits of the Geneva group's isochrones to the (V, V-I) and (T1, C-T1) diagrams, we estimate E(V-I) = 0.25 +/- 0.05 and V-MV= 11.80 +/- 0.25 for logt= 9.15, and E(C-T1) = 0.23 +/- 0.07 and T1-MT1= 11.85 +/- 0.25 for logt= 9.10, respectively, assuming solar metal content. The derived reddening value E(C-T1) implies E(B-V) = 0.12 +/- 0.07 and a distance from the Sun of 2.0 +/- 0.4 kpc. Using the WEBDA data base and the available literature, we re-examined the overall properties of all the open clusters with ages between 0.6 and 2.5 Gyr. We identified peaks of cluster formation at 0.7-0.8, 1.0-1.1, 1.6-1.7 and 2.0-2.1 Gyr, separated by relative quiescent epochs of ~0.2-0.3 Gyr. We also estimated a radial abundance gradient of -0.08 +/- 0.02, which is consistent with the most recent determinations for the Galactic disc, but no clear evidence for a gradient perpendicular to the Galactic plane is found."
2016-08-30,1,"Prospecting for chemical tags among open clusters Determinations of the chemical composition of red giants in a large sample of open clusters show that the abundances of the heavy elements La, Ce, Nd and Sm but not so obviously Y and Eu vary from one cluster to another across a sample all having about the solar metallicity. For La, Ce, Nd and Sm the amplitudes of the variations at solar metallicity scale approximately with the main s-process contribution to solar system material. Consideration of published abundances of field stars suggest that such a spread in heavy element abundances is present for the thin and thick disk stars of different metallicity. This new result provides an opportunity to chemically tag stars by their heavy elements and to reconstruct dissolved open clusters from the field star population."
2008,1,"Ruprecht 1: a Small, Moderately Young Open Cluster in the Third Galactic Quadrant We present CCD observations in the Washington system C and T1 passbands down to T1 ˜ 18.5 in the field of Ruprecht 1, a poorly studied open cluster located in the third Galactic quadrant. We measured T1 magnitudes and C-T1 colors for a total of 862 stars distributed throughout an area of 13.6 × 13.6 arcmin. The cluster turned out to be very small; its linear radius being 2.6 ± 0.2 pc, as estimated from star counts in appropriate-sized boxes distributed throughout the entire field observed. By fitting the zero-age main sequence to the T1 vs. C-T1 color-magnitude diagram, we derive EB-V = 0.25 ± 0.05, independently from the cluster's metallicity. Our analysis suggests that Ruprecht 1 is moderately young. In fact, adopting the theoretical metal contents Z = 0.02 and 0.008, which provide the best global fits, we derive heliocentric distances of d = 1.9 ± 0.4 kpc and 1.5 ± 0.3 kpc and ages of 200 ± 47 Myr and 251 ± 58 Myr in each case."
2004-04-01,1,"The old open cluster Trumpler 5: a reddened, metal-poor anticentre cluster CCD observations in the Johnson V, Kron-Cousins I and the Washington system C and T1 passbands have been used to generate colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reaching down to V~ 21.0 mag and T1~ 19.0 for Trumpler 5, an old open cluster located towards the Galactic anticentre. Our data analysis confirms the existence of non-uniform extinction over the face of the cluster, the mean E(V-I) and E(C-T1) values being 0.80 +/- 0.05 and 1.17 +/- 0.15, respectively. Through comparison of the cluster CMDs with theoretical isochrones of the Geneva group, Washington Standard Giant Branches and measures of δV and δT1 indices, we derive the following values for the cluster apparent distance modulus, age, and metallicity: V-MV= 13.80 +/- 0.30 (corresponding to a distance from the Sun of 2.4 +/- 0.5 kpc and 0.04 kpc above the Galactic plane), t= 5.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr and [Fe/H]=-0.30 +/- 0.15.

2005,1,"Standard Photometric Systems Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies."
2006-10-01,1,"On the current status of open-cluster parameters We aim to characterize the current status of knowledge on the accuracy of open-cluster parameters such as the age, reddening and distance. These astrophysical quantities are often used to study the global characteristics of the Milky Way down to the very local stellar phenomena. In general, the errors of these quantities are neglected or set to some kind of heuristic standard value. We attempt to give some realistic estimates for the accuracy of available cluster parameters by using the independently derived values published in the literature. In total, 6437 individual estimates for 395 open clusters were used in our statistical analysis. We discuss the error sources depending on theoretical as well as observational methods and compare our results with those parameters listed in the widely used catalogue by Dias et al. In addition, we establish a list of 72 open clusters with the most accurate known parameters which should serve as a standard table in the future for testing isochrones and stellar models."
2017-06-01,1,"The open cluster King~1 in the second quadrant We analyse the poorly-studied open cluster King~1 in the second Galactic quadrant. From wide-field photometry we have studied the spatial distribution of this cluster. We determined that the centre of King~1 is located at $\alpha_{2000}=00^{\rm h}22^{\rm m}$ and $\delta_{2000}=+64\degr23\arcmin$. By parameterizing the stellar density with a King profile we have obtained a central density of $\rho_{0}=6.5\pm0.2$ star arcmin$^{-2}$ and a core radius of $r_{\rm core}=1\farcm9\pm0\farcm2$. By comparing the observed color-magnitude diagram of King~1 with those of similar open clusters and with different sets of isochrones, we have estimated an age of $2.8\pm0.3$ Gyr, a distance modulus of $(m-M)_{\rm o}=10.6\pm0.1$ mag, and a reddening of $E(B-V)=0.80\pm0.05$ mag. To complete our analysis we acquired medium resolution spectra for 189 stars in the area of King~1. From their derived radial velocities we determined an average velocity $\left\langle V_r\right\rangle $=-53.1$\pm$3.1 km s$^{-1}$. From the strength of the infrared \mbox{Ca\,{\sc ii}} lines in red giants we have determined an average metallicity of $\left\langle [M/H]\right\rangle$=+0.07$\pm$0.08 dex. From spectral synthesis we have also estimated an $\alpha$-elements abundance of $\left\langle [\alpha/M]\right\rangle$=-0.10$\pm$0.08 dex."
2008-01-01,1,"Structural parameters of star clusters: relations among light, mass and star-count radial profiles, and dependence on photometric depth Context: Structural parameters of model star clusters are measured in radial profiles built from number-density, mass-density and surface-brightness distributions, assuming as well different photometric conditions. Aims: We determine how the core, half-star count and tidal radii, as well as the concentration parameter, all of which are derived from number-density profiles, relate to the equivalent radii measured in near-infrared surface-brightness and mass-density profiles. We also quantify changes in the resulting structural parameters due to depth-limited photometry. Methods: Star clusters of different ages, structure and mass functions are modelled by assuming that the radial distribution of stars follows a pre-defined analytical form. Near-infrared surface brightness and mass-density profiles result from mass-luminosity relations taken from a set of isochrones. Core, tidal and half-light, half-mass and half-star count radii, together with the concentration parameter, are measured in the three types of profiles, which are built under different photometric depths. Results: While surface-brightness profiles are almost insensitive to photometric depth, radii measured in number-density and mass-density profiles change significantly with it. Compared to radii derived with deep photometry, shallow profiles result in lower values. This effect increases for younger ages. Radial profiles of clusters with a spatially-uniform mass function produce radii that do not depend on depth. With deep photometry, number-density profiles yield radii systematically larger than those derived from surface-brightness ones. Conclusions: In general, low-noise surface-brightness profiles result in uniform structural parameters that are essentially independent of photometric depth. For less-populous star clusters, those projected against dense fields and/or distant ones, which result in noisy surface-brightness profiles, this work provides a quantitative way to estimate the intrinsic radii by means of number-density profiles built with depth-limited photometry."

I will focus primarily on the use of stellar evolutionary models to determine the ages and masses of stars, as well as discuss the limitations of such models using a combination of both young clusters and eclipsing binary systems. In addition, I will also highlight a few interesting recent results from large on-going spectroscopic surveys (specifically Gaia-ESO and APOGEE/IN-SYNC) which are continuing to challenge our understanding of the formation and early evolutionary stages of young clusters."
2014,1,"Radial distribution of stars in globular clusters inferred from the Monte Carlo approach In this paper we try to reconstruct the spatial distribution of stars in globular clusters (GCs) from heuristic statistical ideas. Such 3D radial distributions are important for understanding physical conditions across the clusters. Our method is based on converting spherically symmetrical functions such as exp(-r2/s2), exp(-r/s), 1/(1 + r2/s2) 2 and 1/(1 + r2/s2)m, (s and m are parameters) to 2D star distributions in a GCs by the Monte Carlo method. By comparing the obtained 2D profiles with observational ones we demonstrate that Gaussian or exponential distribution functions yield too short extensions of periph-eral parts of the GCs profiles. The best candidate for fitting GCs profiles has been found to be the generalized Schuster density law: C/ (1 + r2/s2)m, where C is the normalization constant and s and m are adjustable parameters. These parameters display a nonlinear correlation with s varying from 0.1 to 10 pc, whilst m is close to 2. Using this law the radiation temperatures across M 13 and 47 Tucane were estimated."
2005-12-01,1,"Resolved Massive Star Clusters in the Milky Way and Its Satellites: Brightness Profiles and a Catalog of Fundamental Parameters We present a database of structural and dynamical properties for 153  spatially resolved star clusters in the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. This database complements and extends others in the literature, such as those of Harris and Mackey & Gilmore. Our cluster sample comprises 50 ``young massive clusters'' in the LMC and SMC, and 103 old globular clusters between the four galaxies. The parameters we list include central and half-light-averaged surface brightnesses and mass densities; core and effective radii; central potentials, concentration parameters, and tidal radii; predicted central velocity dispersions and escape velocities; total luminosities, masses, and binding energies; central phase-space densities; half-mass relaxation times; and ``κ-space'' parameters. We use publicly available population-synthesis models to compute stellar-population properties (intrinsic B-V colors, reddenings, and V-band mass-to-light ratios) for the same 153 clusters plus another 63 globulars in the Milky Way. We also take velocity-dispersion measurements from the literature for a subset of 57 (mostly old) clusters to derive dynamical mass-to-light ratios for them, showing that these compare very well to the population-synthesis predictions. The combined data set is intended to serve as the basis for future investigations of structural correlations and the fundamental plane of massive star clusters, including especially comparisons between the systemic properties of young and old clusters. The structural and dynamical parameters are derived from fitting three different models-the modified isothermal sphere of King; an alternate modified isothermal sphere based on the ad hoc stellar distribution function of Wilson; and asymptotic power-law models with constant-density cores-to the surface-brightness profile of each cluster. Surface-brightness data for the LMC, SMC, and Fornax clusters are based in large part on the work of Mackey & Gilmore, but include significant supplementary data culled from the literature and important corrections to Mackey & Gilmore's V-band magnitude scale. The profiles of Galactic globular clusters are taken from Trager et al. We address the question of which model fits each cluster best, finding in the majority of cases that the Wilson models-which are spatially more extended than King models but still include a finite, ``tidal'' cutoff in density-fit clusters of any age, in any galaxy, as well as or better than King models. Untruncated, asymptotic power laws often fit about as well as Wilson models but can be significantly worse. We argue that the extended halos known to characterize many Magellanic Cloud clusters may be examples of the generic envelope structure of self-gravitating star clusters, not just transient features associated strictly with young age."
2016-09-06,1,"The Search for Multiple Populations in Magellanic Cloud Clusters I: Two Stellar Populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 121 We started a photometric survey using the WFC3/UVIS instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for multiple populations within Magellanic Cloud star clusters at various ages. In this paper, we introduce this survey. As first results of this programme, we also present multi-band photometric observations of NGC 121 in different filters taken with the WFC3/UVIS and ACS/WFC instruments. We analyze the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC 121, which is the only ""classical"" globular cluster within the Small Magellanic Cloud. Thereby, we use the pseudo-colour C_(F336W,F438W,F343N)=(F336W-F438W)-(F438W-F343N) to separate populations with different C and N abundances. We show that the red giant branch splits up in two distinct populations when using this colour combination. NGC 121 thus appears to be similar to Galactic globular clusters in hosting multiple populations. The fraction of enriched stars (N rich, C poor) in NGC 121 is about 32% +/- 3%, which is lower than the median fraction found in Milky Way globular clusters. The enriched population seems to be more centrally concentrated compared to the primordial one. These results are consistent with the recent results by Dalessandro et al. (2016). The morphology of the Horizontal Branch in a CMD using the optical filters F555W and F814W is best produced by a population with a spread in Helium of Delta(Y) =0.025+/-0.005."
2004-07-01,1,"Improvements on the fundamental parameters of the open cluster Tombaugh 1 through Washington system photometry We present CCD photometry in the Washington system C and T1 passbands down to T1 ˜ 18.5 mag in the field of Tombaugh 1, a little studied open cluster located in the third Galactic quadrant. We measured T1 magnitudes and C-T1 colours for a total of 1351 stars distributed throughout an area of 13.6 arcmin × 13.6 arcmin. A cluster radius of 4.3 arcmin ± 0.3 arcmin was estimated from star counts in 100-pixel a side boxes distributed throughout the entire observed field. Based on the best fits of isochrones computed by the Geneva group for Z = 0.008 to the T1 vs. C-T1 colour-magnitude diagram, we derive a colour excess E(C-T1) = 0.55 ± 0.10, equivalent to E(B-V) = 0.30 ± 0.05, a distance of (2.2 ± 0.5) kpc from the Sun and an age of 1.3 +0.1-0.2 Gyr. The latter value is in good agreement with that derived from the independent metallicity δT1 index defined in Geisler et al. (1997, AJ, 114, 1920). An independent metallicity estimation using the [MT_1, (C-T1)0] plane with the standard giant branches of Geisler & Sarajedini (1999, AJ, 117, 308) yields [Fe/H] = -0.30 ± 0.25 dex, a value which lends support to the one obtained from the isochrone fit. Tombaugh 1 is then found to be a relatively metal-poor intermediate-age open cluster."
2017-01-01,1,"A Chandra X-ray census of the interacting binaries in old open clusters - Collinder 261 We present the first X-ray study of Collinder 261 (Cr261), which at an  age of 7 Gyr is one of the oldest open clusters known in the Galaxy. Our observation with the Chandra X-ray Observatory is aimed at uncovering the close interacting binaries in Cr261, and reaches a limiting X-ray luminosity of Lx ~ 4e29 erg/s (0.3-7 keV) for stars in the cluster. We detect 107 sources within the cluster half-mass radius r_h, and we estimate that among the sources with Lx >~ 1e30 erg/s, ~26 are associated with the cluster. We identify a mix of active binaries and candidate active binaries, candidate cataclysmic variables, and stars that have ""straggled"" from the main locus of Cr261 in the colour-magnitude diagram. Based on a deep optical source catalogue of the field, we estimate that Cr261 has an approximate mass of 6500 M_sun, roughly the same as the old open cluster NGC6791. The X-ray emissivity of Cr261 is similar to that of other old open clusters, supporting the trend that they are more luminous in X-rays per unit mass than old populations of higher (globular clusters) and lower (the local neighbourhood) stellar density. This implies that the dynamical destruction of binaries in the densest environments is not solely responsible for the observed differences in X-ray emissivity."
2017-04-01,1,"On the physical reality of overlooked open clusters We present UBVRI and CT1T2 photometry for 15 catalogued open clusters of relative high brightness and compact appearance. From these unprecedented photometric data sets, covering wavelengths from the blue up to the near-infrared, we performed a thorough assessment of their reality as stellar aggregates. We statistically assigned to each observed star within the object region a probability of being a fiducial feature of that field in terms of its local luminosity function, colour distribution and stellar density. Likewise, we used accurate parallaxes and proper motions measured by the Gaia satellite to help our decision on the open cluster reality. 10 catalogued aggregates did not show any hint of being real physical systems; three of them had been assumed to be open clusters in previous studies, though. On the other hand, we estimated reliable fundamental parameters for the remaining five studied objects, which were confirmed as real open clusters. They resulted to be clusters distributed in a wide age range, 8.0 ≤ log (t yr-1) ≤ 9.4, of solar metal content and placed between 2.0 and 5.5 kpc from the Sun. Their ages and metallicities are in agreement with the presently known picture of the spatial distribution of open clusters in the Galactic disc."

2016-09-04,1,"Stellar populations in star clusters Stellar populations contain the most important information about star clus- ter formation and evolution. Until several decades ago, star clusters were believed to be ideal laboratories for studies of simple stellar populations (SSPs). However, discoveries of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters have expanded our view on stellar populations in star clusters. They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies, particularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old globular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP scenario does not seem to hold for some intermediate-age and young star clusters either, thus making the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters even more complicated. Stellar population anomalies in numerous star clusters are well-documented, implying that the notion of star clusters as true SSPs faces serious challenges. In this review, we focus on stellar populations in massive clusters with different ages. We present the history and progress of research in this active field, as well as some of the most recent improvements, including observational results and scenar- ios that have been proposed to explain the observations. Although our current ability to determine the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters is unsatisfactory, we propose a number of promising projects that may contribute to a significantly improved understanding of this subject."
2016-06-16,1,"The tight subgiant branch of the intermediate-age star cluster NGC 411 implies a single-aged stellar population The presence of extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) regions in intermediate-age star clusters in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds is often interpreted as resulting from extended star-formation histories (SFHs), lasting $\geq$ 300 Myr. This strongly conflicts with the traditional view of the dominant star-formation mode in stellar clusters, which are thought of as single-aged stellar populations. Here we present a test of this interpretation by exploring the morphology of the subgiant branch (SGB) of NGC 411, which hosts possibly the most extended eMSTO among all known intermediate-age star clusters. We show that the width of the NGC 411 SGB favours the single-aged stellar population interpretation and rules out an extended SFH. In addition, when considering the red clump (RC) morphology and adopting the unproven premise that the widths of all features in the colour--magnitude diagram are determined by an underlying range in ages, we find that the SFH implied is still very close to that resulting from a single-aged stellar population, with a minor fraction of stars scattering to younger ages compared with the bulk of the population. The SFHs derived from the SGB and RC are both inconsistent with the SFH derived from the eMSTO region. NGC 411 has a very low escape velocity and it has unlikely undergone significant mass loss at an early stage, thus indicating that it may lack the capacity to capture most of its initial, expelled gas from stellar evolutionary processes, a condition often required for extended SFHs to take root."

The given apparent visual magnitude limit for the targets, can be immediately transformed into a distance limit of about 750 pc around the Sun depending on the absolute magnitude. For a spectral type of A0, we are, for example, limited to about 65 pc only. With the help of WEBDA (http://www.univie.ac.at/webda), we have found 60 possible candidates which are true members of star clusters (including associations). The membership offers the opportunity to use the results from a detailed cluster analysis ``for free''. This includes the determination of the age, the distance, the reddening, the overall metallicity and thus the mass with a high accuracy. These are very valuable starting parameters for any detailed astrophysical study of an individual object."
2011-09,1,"Internal Structure of Stellar Clusters: Geometry of Star Formation The study of the internal structure of star clusters provides important clues concerning their formation mechanism and dynamical evolution. There are both observational and numerical evidences indicating that open clusters evolve from an initial clumpy structure, presumably a direct consequence of the formation in a fractal medium, toward a centrally condensed state. This simple picture has, however, several drawbacks. There can be very young clusters exhibiting radial patterns maybe reflecting the early effect of gravity on primordial gas. There can be also very evolved cluster showing fractal patterns that either have survived through time or have been generated subsequently by some (unknown) mechanism. Additionally, the fractal structure of some open clusters is much clumpier than the average structure of the interstellar medium in the Milky Way, although in principle a very similar structure should be expected. Here we summarize and discuss observational and numerical results concerning this subject."
2010-02-01,1,"The Stellar Population of h and χ Persei: Cluster Properties, Membership, and the Intrinsic Colors and Temperatures of Stars From photometric observations of ~ 47,000 stars and spectroscopy of ~  11,000 stars, we describe the first extensive study of the stellar population of the famous Double Cluster, h and χ Persei, down to subsolar masses. By analyzing optical spectra and optical/infrared photometry, we constrain the distance moduli (dM), reddening (E(B - V)), and ages for h Persei, χ Persei, and the low-density halo population surrounding both cluster cores. With the exception of mass and spatial distribution, the clusters are nearly identical in every measurable way. Both clusters have E(B - V) ~ 0.52-0.55 and dM = 11.8-11.85; the halo population, while more poorly constrained, likely has identical properties. As determined from the main-sequence turnoff, the luminosity of M supergiants, and pre-main-sequence isochrones, ages for h Persei, χ Persei, and the halo population all converge on ≈14 Myr, thus showing a stunning agreement between estimates based on entirely different physics. From these data, we establish the first spectroscopic and photometric membership lists of cluster stars down to early/mid M dwarfs. At minimum, there are ~ 5000 members within 10' of the cluster centers, while the entire h and χ Persei region has at least ~ 13,000 and as many as 20,000 members. The Double Cluster contains ≈ 8400 M sun of stars within 10' of the cluster centers. We estimate a total mass of at least 20,000 M sun. We conclude our study by outlining outstanding questions regarding the past and present properties of h and χ Persei. From comparing recent work, we compile a list of intrinsic colors and derive a new effective temperature scale for O-M dwarfs, giants, and supergiants."
2011-06-01,1,"Star clusters or asterisms? 2MASS CMD and structural analyses of 15 challenging targets Context. Poorly-populated star clusters may have photometric and  structural properties not much different from asterisms, to the point that, in some cases, widely-used databases present conflicting classifications. Aims: We investigate the nature of a sample of challenging targets that have been classified either as star clusters or asterisms in different studies. A few objects are studied for the first time. Methods: The analysis employs 2MASS photometry, field-star decontamination, to enhance the intrinsic colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) morphology, and colour-magnitude filters, for high contrast stellar radial density profiles (RDPs). Results: Based on properties derived from field-star decontaminated CMDs, and structural parameters from RDPs, we find that Pismis 12, IC 1434, Juchert 10, Ruprecht 30, NGC 3519, Herschel 1, Mayer 1, and Muzzio 1 are open clusters with ages within 5 Myr - 1.3 Gyr. Ruprecht 129, 130, 140, and 146 are borderline cases, being rather poorly-populated, with evolutionary sequences and RDPs suggesting star clusters. Dolidze 39, BH 79, and Ruprecht 103, have CMDs and RDPs typical of asterisms. Conclusions: When a low stellar population is associated with a dense field contamination and/or important differential reddening, only a thin line separates star clusters and asterisms. These cases require specific analytical tools to establish their nature. Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org"
2011-03-01,1,"Star formation in the outer Galaxy: membership and fundamental parameters of the young open cluster NGC 1893 Context. Different environmental conditions can play a crucial role in  determining final products of the star formation process, and in this context, less favorable activities of star formation are expected in the external regions of our Galaxy. Aims: We studied the properties of the young open cluster NGC 1893 located about 12 Kpc from the galactic center, to investigate how different physical conditions can affect the process of star formation. Methods: By adopting a multiwavelength approach, we compiled a catalog extending from X-rays to NIR data to derive the cluster membership. In addition, optical and NIR photometric properties are used to evaluate the cluster parameters. Results: We find 415 diskless candidate members and 1061 young stellar objects with a circumstellar disk or class II candidate members, 125 of which are also Hα emitters. Considering the diskless candidate members, we find that the cluster distance is 3.6 ± 0.2 kpc and the mean interstellar reddening is E(B - V) = 0.6 ± 0.1 with evidence of differential reddening in the whole surveyed region. Conclusions: NGC 1893 contains a conspicuous population of pre-main sequence stars, together with the well-studied main sequence cluster population. We found a disk fraction of about 70% similar to the one found in clusters of similar age in the solar neighbor and then, despite expected unfavorable conditions for star formation, we conclude that very rich young clusters can also form in the outer regions of our Galaxy.

2010-06-01,1,"Internal Dynamics and Membership of the NGC 3603 Young Cluster from Microarcsecond Astrometry We have analyzed two epochs of HST/WFPC2 observations of the young  Galactic starburst cluster in NGC 3603 with the aim to study its internal dynamics and stellar population. Relative proper motions measured over 10.15 yrs of more than 800 stars enable us to distinguish cluster members from field stars. The best-fitting isochrone yields A V = 4.6-4.7 mag, a distance of 6.6-6.9 kpc, and an age of 1 Myr for NGC 3603 Young Cluster (NYC). We identify pre-main-sequence/main-sequence transition stars located in the short-lived radiative-convective gap, which in the NYC occurs in the mass range 3.5-3.8 M sun. We also identify a sparse population of stars with an age of 4 Myr, which appear to be the lower mass counterparts to previously discovered blue supergiants located in the giant H II region NGC 3603. For the first time, we are able to measure the internal velocity dispersion of a starburst cluster from 234 stars with I < 18.5 mag to σpm1D = 141 ± 27μas yr-1 (4.5 ± 0.8 km s-1 at a distance of 6.75 kpc). As stars with masses between 1.7 and 9 M sun all exhibit the same velocity dispersion, the cluster stars have not yet reached equipartition of kinetic energy (i.e., the cluster is not in virial equilibrium). The results highlight the power of combining high-precision astrometry and photometry, and emphasize the role of NYC as a benchmark object for testing stellar evolution models and dynamical models for young clusters, and as a template for extragalactic starburst clusters."
2010-03-01,1,"Death of a Cluster: The Destruction of M67 as Seen by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey We probe the spatial and dynamical structure of the old open cluster M67  using photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's sixth data release. Making use of an optimal contrast, or matched filter, algorithm, we map the distribution of high probability members of M67. We find an extended and elongated halo of likely members to a radius of nearly 60'. Our measured core radius of R core = 8farcm24 ± 0farcm60 is somewhat larger than that of previous estimates. We attribute the larger core radius measurement to the SDSS probing lower mass main sequence stars than has been done before for similar studies of M67, and the exclusion of post-main-sequence M67 members in the SDSS sample. We estimate the number of M67 members in our SDSS sample to be 1385 ± 67 stars. A lower limit on the binary fraction in M67 is measured to be 45%. A higher fraction of binary stars is measured in the core as compared to the halo, and the luminosity function of the core is found to be more depleted of low-mass stars. Thus, the halo is consistent with mass segregation within the cluster. The galactic orbit of M67 is calculated from recent proper motion and radial velocity determinations. The elongated halo is roughly aligned to the proper motion of the cluster. This appears to be a result of mass segregation due to the galactic tidal field. Our algorithm is run on Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry to directly compare to previous studies of M67. Decreasing core radii is found for stars with greater masses. We test the accuracy of our algorithm using 1000 artificial cluster Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that the matched filter technique is suitable for recovering low-density spatial structures, as well as measuring the binary fraction of the cluster."
2014-02-13,1,"Star clusters in M33: updated UBVRI photometry, ages, metallicities, and masses The photometric characterization of M33 star clusters is far from complete. In this paper, we present homogeneous $UBVRI$ photometry of 708 star clusters and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the galaxy's major axis. Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the $UBVRI$ bands, respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published $UBVRI$ photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky Survey $ugriz$ photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron All-Sky Survey near-infrared $JHK$ photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated {\sc parsec} simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our $\chi^2$ minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters ($31\%$) are older than 2 Gyr, which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 ($56\%$), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ($<1$ Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clusters---both open and globular clusters---in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are $\log(M_{\rm cl}/M_{\odot})=4.25$, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling effects."
2012-09-01,1,"The Size Scale of Star Clusters Direct N-body simulations of star clusters in a realistic Milky-Way-like potential are carried out using the code NBODY6. Based on these simulations, a new relationship between scale size and galactocentric distance is derived: the scale size of star clusters is proportional to the hyperbolic tangent of the galactocentric distance. The half-mass radius of star clusters increases systematically with galactocentric distance but levels off when star clusters orbit the galaxy beyond ~40 kpc. These simulations show that the half-mass radius of individual star clusters varies significantly as they evolve over a Hubble time, more so for clusters with shorter relaxation times, and remains constant through several relaxation times only in certain situations when expansion driven by the internal dynamics of the star cluster and the influence of the host galaxy tidal field balance each other. Indeed, the radius of a star cluster evolving within the inner 20 kpc of a realistic galactic gravitational potential is severely truncated by tidal interactions and does not remain constant over a Hubble time. Furthermore, the half-mass radius of star clusters measured with present-day observations bears no memory of the original cluster size. Stellar evolution and tidal stripping are the two competing physical mechanisms that determine the present-day size of globular clusters. These simulations also show that extended star clusters can form at large galactocentric distances while remaining fully bound to the host galaxy. There is thus no need to invoke accretion from an external galaxy to explain the presence of extended clusters at large galactocentric distances in a Milky-Way-type galaxy."
2014-04-01,1,uvby-β Photoelectric photometry and membership determination of the Open Cluster NGC 2353 From uvby-beta photoelectric photometry of the open cluster NGC 2353 (55  stars) we were able to determine membership of the stars to the cluster and fix its age and reddening.
2014-06-01,1,"CCD $UBV(RI)_{C}$ Photometry of Twenty Open Clusters Fundamental astrophysical parameters have been derived for 20 open clusters (O\!Cs) using CCD~$U\!BV\!(RI)_C$ photometric data observed with the 84~cm telescope at the San Pedro M\'artir National Astronomical Observatory, M\'exico. The interstellar reddenings, metallicities, distances, and ages have been compared to the literature values. Significant differences are usually due to the usage of diverse empirical calibrations and differing assumptions, such as concerning cluster metallicity, as well as distinct isochrones which correspond to differing element-abundance ratios, internal stellar physics, and photometric systems. Different interstellar reddenings, as well as varying reduction and cluster-membership techniques, are also responsible for these kinds of systematic differences and errors. The morphological ages, which are derived from the morphological indices ($\delta V$ and $\delta 1$) in the CM diagrams, are in good agreement with the isochrone ages of 12 O\!Cs, those with good red clump (RC) and red giant (RG) star candidates. No metal abundance gradient is detected for the range $6.82 \leq R_{GC} \leq 15.37$ kpc, nor any correlation between the cluster ages and metal abundances for these 20 O\!Cs. Young, metal-poor O\!Cs, observed here in the third Galactic quadrant, may be associated with stellar over-densities, such as that in Canis Major (Martin et al.) and the Monoceros Ring (Newberg et al.), or signatures of past accretion events, as discussed by Yong et al. and Carraro et al."
2012-04-01,1,"The present-day mass function of the Quintuplet cluster based on proper motion membership Context. The stellar mass function is a probe for a potential dependence  of star formation on the environment. Only a few young clusters are known to reside within the central molecular zone and can serve as testbeds for star formation under the extreme conditions in this region.  Aims: We determine the present-day mass function of the Quintuplet cluster, a young massive cluster in the vicinity of the Galactic centre. Methods: We use two epochs of high resolution near infrared imaging data obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the ESO VLT to measure the individual proper motions of stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the cluster reference frame. An unbiased sample of cluster members within a radius of 0.5 pc from the cluster centre was established based on their common motion with respect to the field and a subsequent colour-cut. Initial stellar masses were inferred from four isochrones covering ages from 3 to 5 Myr and two sets of stellar evolution models. For each isochrone, the present-day mass function of stars was determined for the full sample of main sequence cluster members using an equal number binning scheme. Results: We find the slope of the present-day mass function in the central part of the Quintuplet cluster to be α = -1.68+0.13-0.09, which is significantly flatter than the Salpeter slope of α = -2.35. The flattening of the present-day mass function may be caused by rapid dynamical evolution of the cluster in the strong Galactic centre tidal field. The derived mass function slope is compared to the values found in other young massive clusters in the Galaxy. Based on observations collected at the ESO/VLT under Program ID 71.C-0344(A) (PI: F.

2014-10-01,1,"CCD UBVRI photometry of NGC 6811 We present the results of CCD UBVRI observations of the open cluster NGC 6811 obtained on 18th July 2012 with the 1m telescope at the T\""UB\.ITAK National Observatory (TUG). Using these photometric results, we determine the structural and astrophysical parameters of the cluster. The mean photometric uncertainties are better than 0.02 mag in the V magnitude and B-V, V-R, and V-I colour indices to about 0.03 mag for U-B among stars brighter than magnitude V=18. Cluster member stars were separated from the field stars using the Galaxia model of Sharma et al. (2011) together with other techniques. The core radius of the cluster is found to be $r_{c}$=3.60 arcmin. The astrophysical parameters were determined simultaneously via Bayesian statistics using the colour-magnitude diagrams V versus B-V, V versus V-I, V versus V-R, and V versus R-I of the cluster. The resulting most likely parameters were further confirmed using independent methods, removing any possible degeneracies. The colour excess, distance modulus, metallicity and the age of the cluster are determined simultaneously as E(B-V)=0.05$\pm$0.01 mag, $\mu=10.06\pm0.08$ mag, [M/H]=-0.10$\pm$0.01 dex and t=1.00$\pm$0.05 Gyr, respectively. Distances of five red clump stars which were found to be members of the cluster further confirm our distance estimation."
2008-12-01,1,"Maximum stellar mass versus cluster membership number revisited We have made a new compilation of observations of maximum stellar mass versus cluster membership number from the literature, which we analyse for consistency with the predictions of a simple random drawing hypothesis for stellar mass selection in clusters. Previously, Weidner and Kroupa have suggested that the maximum stellar mass is lower, in low-mass clusters, than would be expected on the basis of random drawing, and have pointed out that this could have important implications for steepening the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) at high masses. Our compilation demonstrates how the observed distribution in the plane of maximum stellar mass versus membership number is affected by the method of target selection; in particular, rather low n clusters with large maximum stellar masses are abundant in observational data sets that specifically seek clusters in the environs of high-mass stars. Although we do not consider our compilation to be either complete or unbiased, we discuss the method by which such data should be statistically analysed. Our very provisional conclusion is that the data are not indicating any striking deviation from the expectations of random drawing."
2015-11-03,1,"A Dynamical Evolution Study of 40 2MASS Open Clusters We investigate the dynamical evolution of 40 open clusters (OCs) by means of their astrophysical parameters derived from field-decontaminated 2MASS photometry. We find a bifurcation in the planes core radius vs. age and cluster radius vs. age, in which part of the clusters appear to expand with time probably due to the presence of stellar black holes while others seem to shrink due to dynamical relaxation. Mass functions (MFs) are built for 3$/$4 of the sample (31 OCs), which are used to search for indications of mass segregation and external dynamical processes by means of relations among astrophysical, structural and evolutionary parameters. We detect a flattening of MF slopes ocurring at the evolutionary parameters $\tau_{core}\leq 32$ and $\tau_{overall}\leq 30$, respectively. Within the uncertainties involved, the overall MF slopes of 14 out of 31 OCs with $m_{overall} > 500~M_{\odot}$ are consistent with Kroupa's initial mass function, implying little or no dynamical evolution for these clusters. The remaining 17 OCs with MF slopes departing from that of Kroupa show mild/large scale mass segregation due to dynamical evolution."

Over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions with molecular clouds or tidal stripping, and their members become part of the general field population. Star clusters are thus among the basic building blocks of galaxies. In turn, star cluster populations, from young associations and open clusters to old globulars, are powerful tracers of the formation, assembly, and evolutionary history of their parent galaxies. Although their importance had been recognised for decades, major progress in this area has only become possible in recent years, both for Galactic and extragalactic cluster populations.

We have initiated the photometric survey of young open clusters in the Galaxy, from which the stellar IMFs are obtained in a homogeneous way. A total of 16 famous young open clusters have preferentially been studied up to now. These clusters have a wide range of surface densities (log sigma = -1 to 3 [stars pc^2] for stars with mass larger than 5M_sun) and cluster masses (M_cl = 165 to 50,000M_sun), and also are distributed in five different spiral arms in the Galaxy. It is possible to test the dependence of star formation processes on the global properties of individual clusters or environmental conditions.

2016-11-08,1,"Radial velocities and metallicities of red giant stars in the old open cluster NGC 7762 We present and discuss radial velocity and the very first metallicity measurements for nine evolved stars in the poorly known old open cluster NGC 7762. We isolated eight radial velocity cluster members and one interloper. Radial velocities are in good agreement with previous studies. NGC 7762 turns out to be of solar metallicity within the uncertainties ([Fe/H]=0.04$\pm$0.12). For this metallicity, the cluster age is 2.5$\pm$0.2 Gyr, and falls in a age range where only a few old open clusters are known. With respect to previous studies, we find a larger distance, implying the cluster to be located at 900$^{+70}_{-50}$ pc from the Sun. For most of the elements we measure solar-scaled abundance ratios. We searched the literature for open clusters of similar age in the solar vicinity and found that NGC 7762 can be considered a twin of Ruprecht 147, a similar age cluster located at only 300 pc from the Sun. In fact, beside age, also metallicity and abundance ratios are very close to Ruprecht 147 values within the observational uncertainties."
2017-04-01,1,"NGC 6067: a young and massive open cluster with high metallicity NGC 6067 is a young open cluster hosting the largest population of evolved stars among known Milky Way clusters in the 50-150 Ma age range. It thus represents the best laboratory in our Galaxy to constrain the evolutionary tracks of 5-7 M$_{\odot}$ stars. We have used high-resolution spectra of a large sample of bright cluster members (45), combined with archival photometry, to obtain accurate parameters for the cluster as well as stellar atmospheric parameters. We derive a distance of 1.78$\pm$0.12 kpc, an age of 90$\pm$20 Ma and a tidal radius of 14.8$^{6.8}_{3.2}$ arcmin. We estimate an initial mass above 5700 M$_{\odot}$, for a present-day evolved population of two Cepheids, two A supergiants and 12 red giants with masses $\approx$6 M$_{\odot}$. We also determine chemical abundances of Li, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, Rb, Y and Ba for the red clump stars. We find a supersolar metallicity, [Fe/H]=+0.19$\pm$0.05, and a homogeneus chemical composition, consistent with the Galactic metallicity gradient. The presence of a Li-rich red giant, star 276 with A(Li)=2.41, is also detected. An over-abundance of Ba is found, supporting the enhanced $s$-process. The ratio of yellow to red giants is much smaller than one, in agreement with models with moderate overshooting, but the properties of the cluster Cepheids do not seem consistent with current Padova models for supersolar metallicity."

2016-08-29,1,"Formation of anomalous globular clusters with metallicity spreads: A unified picture Recent observations have revealed that at least 8 globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy show internal abundance spreads in [Fe/H]. We investigate the origin of these `anomalous' GCs using numerical simulations of GCs in the dwarfs orbiting around the Galaxy and chemical evolution model of dwarfs hosting the GCs. The principal results are as follows. GCs formed in a host dwarf galaxy with a total mass of ~ 10^10 M_sun can merge to form a single nuclear GC before the host is completely destroyed by the Galaxy, if they are massive (> 3*10^5 M_sun) and if they are formed in the inner region (R<400 pc). The GC merger remnants can capture field stars during its spiral-in to nuclear regions. If two GCs are formed from star formation events separated by ~300 Myr in their host dwarf, then the new GC formed from GC merging can have [Fe/H] spread of 0.2 dex and [Ba/Fe] spread of 0.3 dex. GCs formed from GC merging can show variety of internal abundance spreads depending on the details of their hosts' chemical evolution. We suggest that anomalous GCs were formed from GC merging that occurred before the destruction of GC host dwarfs yet after self-enrichment processes responsible for the observed anti-correlations between chemical abundances of light elements. We also suggest that the observed no/little dependence of [Eu/Fe] on [Fe/H] in the Galactic GC M22 is evidence of massive dwarf galaxies hosting these anomalous GCs."
2017-04-01,1,"New Compact Star Cluster Candidates in the Galactic Plane The sample of known star clusters, the fundamental building blocks of galaxies, in the Milky Way is still extremely incomplete for objects beyond a distance of 1-2kpc. Many of the more distant and young clusters are compact and hidden behind large amounts of extinction. We thus utilised the deep high resolution near infrared surveys UGPS and VVV to uncover so far unknown compact clusters and to analyse their properties. Images of all objects in the area covered by these two surveys, and which are listed as Galaxy in SIMBAD have been inspected and 125 so far unknown stellar clusters and candidate clusters have been identified. Based on the frequent associations with star formation indicators (nebulosities, IRAS sources, Hii regions, masers) we find that the typical cluster in our sample is young, at distances between 1-10kpc and has a typical apparent radius of 25arcsec. We suggest more systematic searches e.g. at all positions of 2MASS extended sources to increase the completeness of the known cluster sample beyond distances of 2kpc."
2007-07-01,1,"NGC2236: a moderately metal-poor open cluster of Hyades-like age located beyond the Perseus spiral arm New CCD photometry in the Washington system C and T1 passbands down to T1 ~ 18.5 mag in the field of the northern open cluster NGC2236 is presented. T1 magnitudes and C - T1 colours for a total of 1162 stars within an area of 13.6 × 13.6 arcmin2 were measured. These CCD data were supplemented with photoelectric CMT1T2 photometry of 13 red giant candidates. The comparison of the cluster (T1, C - T1) colour-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones computed for the Washington system yields E(C - T1) = 1.10 +/- 0.10 and for log t = 8.80 (t = 600+100-40 Myr) and Z = 0.008. The derived E(C - T1) value implies E(B - V) = 0.55 +/- 0.05. NGC2236 is then located at 2.5 +/- 0.5 kpc from the Sun beyond the Perseus spiral arm and at ~10.8 kpc from the Galactic centre. A cluster angular diameter of 9.4 arcmin, equivalent to 6.8 pc, was estimated from star counts both within and outside the cluster field. We also derived from the stellar density profile a cluster core radius of rc = 1.7 arcmin (1.2 pc) and an annular corona of Δrc = 1.8rc (2.2 pc). Five independent Washington abundance indices yield a mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.3 +/- 0.2, which is not only in reasonably good agreement with the one obtained from the isochrone fit, but also compatible with the existence of a radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disc. We examined the properties of a sample of 20 known open clusters aligned along the line-of-sight to NGC2236. Berkeley27 appears as the farthest and oldest cluster of the studied sample."

To support our classification of the stellar populations, we compare our FUV-NUV CMD with optical data from the ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters. The FUV-NUV CMD indicates 16 sources located in the WD area, and ten BSs within the 25""x 25"" of the STIS FUV data. Eighteen Chandra X-ray sources are located within the FUV field of view. Thirteen of those have a NUV counterpart, of which nine sources also have a FUV counterpart. Out of those, five sources are previously suggested CVs, and indeed all five are located in the WD/CV region in our FUV-NUV CMD. Another CV only has a FUV but no NUV counterpart. We also detect a NUV (but no FUV) counterpart to the MSP located in the core of this cluster. The NUV lightcurves of the CVs and MSP show flickering behaviour typical of CVs. We found that the BSs and CVs are the most centrally concentrated population. This might be an effect of mass segregation or indicate the preferred birth place of BSs and CVs via dynamical interactions in the dense core region of GCs. HB stars are the least centrally concentrated population and absent in the innermost area of the core."

Employing an updated version of our binary stellar evolution code we demonstrate that EHB stars naturally emerge from the common envelope phase. In sum, the binary model reproduces the observed ($T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log{g}$) and temporal properties of the EHB over-density tied to NGC 6971, without needing an ad-hoc and anomalous mass-loss prescription."
2016-08-16,1,"Star Clusters in the Magellanic Clouds-1: Parameterisation and Classification of 1072 Clusters in the LMC We have introduced a semi-automated quantitative method to estimate the age and reddening of 1072 star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) III survey data. This study brings out 308 newly parameterised clusters. In a first of its kind, the LMC clusters are classified into groups based on richness/mass as very poor, poor, moderate and rich clusters, similar to the classification scheme of open clusters in the Galaxy. A major cluster formation episode is found to happen at 125 +- 25 Myr in the inner LMC. The bar region of the LMC appears prominently in the age range 60 - 250 Myr and is found to have a relatively higher concentration of poor and moderate clusters. The eastern and the western ends of the bar are found to form clusters initially, which later propagates to the central part. We demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the distribution of clusters as a function of mass, using a movie based on the propagation (in space and time) of cluster formation in various groups. The importance of including the low mass clusters in the cluster formation history is demonstrated. The catalog with parameters, classification, and cleaned and isochrone fitted CMDs of 1072 clusters, which are available as online material, can be further used to understand the hierarchical formation of clusters in selected regions of the LMC."
2017-06-01,1,"A Multi-Wavelength Study of the Segue 3 Cluster We present new SDSS and Washington photometry of the young, outer-halo stellar system, Segue 3. Combined with archival VI-observations, our most consistent results yield: $Z=0.006$, $\log(Age)=9.42$, $(m-M)_0=17.35$, $E(B-V)=0.09$, with a high binary fraction of $0.39\pm 0.05$, using the Padova models. We confirm that mass segregation has occurred, supporting the hypothesis that this cluster is being tidally disrupted. A 3-parameter King model yields a cluster radius of $r_{cl}=0.017^\circ$, a core radius of $r_{c}=0.003^\circ$, and a tidal radius of $r_t=0.04^\circ \pm 0.02^\circ$. A comparison of Padova and Dartmouth model-grids indicates that the cluster is not significantly $\alpha$-enhanced, with a mean [Fe/H]$=-0.55^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$ dex, and a population age of only $2.6\pm 0.4$ Gyr. We rule out a statistically-significant age spread at the main sequence turnoff because of a narrow subgiant branch, and discuss the role of stellar rotation and cluster age, using Dartmouth and Geneva models: approximately 70% of the Seg 3 stars at or below the main sequence turnoff have enhanced rotation. Our results for Segue 3 indicate that it is younger and more metal-rich than all previous studies have reported to-date. From colors involving Washington-C and SDSS-u filters, we identify several giants and a possible blue-straggler for future follow-up spectroscopic studies, and we produce spectral energy distributions of previously known members and potential Segue 3 sources with Washington ($CT_1$), Sloan (ugri), and VI-filters. Segue 3 shares the characteristics of unusual stellar systems which have likely been stripped from external dwarf galaxies as they are being accreted by the Milky Way, or that have been formed during such an event. Its youth, metallicity, and location are all inconsistent with Segue 3 being a cluster native to the Milky Way."
2018-01-01,1,"A survey for low-mass stellar and substellar members of the Hyades open cluster Unlike young open clusters (with ages <250 Myr), the Hyades cluster (age ~600 Myr) has a clear deficit of very low-mass stars (VLM) and brown dwarfs (BD). Since this open cluster has a low stellar density and covers several tens of square degrees on the sky, extended surveys are required to improve the statistics of the VLM/BD objects in the cluster. We search for new VLM stars and BD candidates in the Hyades to improve the present-day cluster mass function down to substellar masses. An imaging survey of the Hyades with a completeness limit of 21m.5 in the $R$ band and 20m.5 in the $I$ band was carried out with the 2kx2k CCD Schmidt camera at the 2m Alfred Jensch Telescope in Tautenburg. We performed a photometric selection of the cluster member candidates by combining results of our survey with 2MASS JHKs photometry. We present a photometric and proper motion survey covering 23.4 deg$^2$ in the Hyades cluster core region. Using optical/IR colour-magnitude diagrams, we identify 66 photometric cluster member candidates in the magnitude range 14m.7"

The LkH$\alpha$ 101 cluster The LkH$\alpha$ 101 cluster takes its name from its more massive member,  the LkH$\alpha$ 101star, which is an $\sim15$ M$_\odot$ star whose true nature is still unknown. The distance to the LkH$\alpha$ 101 cluster has been controversial for the last few decades, with estimated values ranging from 160 to 800 pc. We have observed members and candidate members of the LkH$\alpha$ 101 cluster with signs of magnetic activity, using the Very Long Baseline Array, in order to measure their trigonometric parallax and, thus, obtain a direct measurement of their distances. A young star member, LkH$\alpha$ 101 VLA J043001.15+351724.6, was detected at four epochs as a single radio source. The best fit to its displacement on the plane of the sky yields a distance of 535$\pm$29 pc. We argue that this is the distance to the LkH$\alpha$ 101 cluster."
2015-12-21,1,"The star cluster mass--galactocentric radius relation: Implications for cluster formation Whether or not the initial star cluster mass function is established through a universal, galactocentric-distance-independent stochastic process, on the scales of individual galaxies, remains an unsolved problem. This debate has recently gained new impetus through the publication of a study that concluded that the maximum cluster mass in a given population is not solely determined by size-of-sample effects. Here, we revisit the evidence in favor and against stochastic cluster formation by examining the young ($\lesssim$ a few $\times 10^8$ yr-old) star cluster mass--galactocentric radius relation in M33, M51, M83, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. To eliminate size-of-sample effects, we first adopt radial bin sizes containing constant numbers of clusters, which we use to quantify the radial distribution of the first- to fifth-ranked most massive clusters using ordinary least-squares fitting. We supplement this analysis with an application of quantile regression, a binless approach to rank-based regression taking an absolute-value-distance penalty. Both methods yield, within the $1\sigma$ to $3\sigma$ uncertainties, near-zero slopes in the diagnostic plane, largely irrespective of the maximum age or minimum mass imposed on our sample selection, or of the radial bin size adopted. We conclude that, at least in our four well-studied sample galaxies, star cluster formation does not necessarily require an environment-dependent cluster formation scenario, which thus supports the notion of stochastic star cluster formation as the dominant star cluster-formation process within a given galaxy."
2016-10-26,1,"The little-studied cluster Berkeley 90. III. Cluster parameters The open cluster Berkeley 90 is the home to one of the most massive binary systems in the Galaxy, LS III +46$^{\circ}$11, formed by two identical, very massive stars (O3.5 If* + O3.5 If*), and a second early-O system (LS III +46$^{\circ}$12 with an O4.5 IV((f)) component at least). Stars with spectral types earlier than O4 are very scarce in the Milky Way, with no more than 20 examples. The formation of such massive stars is still an open question today, and thus the study of the environments where the most massive stars are found can shed some light on this topic. To this aim, we determine the properties and characterize the population of Berkeley 90 using optical, near-infrared and WISE photometry and optical spectroscopy. This is the first determination of these parameters with accuracy. We find a distance of $3.5^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ kpc and a maximum age of 3 Ma. The cluster mass is around $1000$ $M_{\odot}$ (perhaps reaching $1500$ $M_{\odot}$ if the surrounding population is added), and we do not detect candidate runaway stars in the area. There is a second population of young stars to the Southeast of the cluster that may have formed at the same time or slightly later, with some evidence for low-activity ongoing star formation."
2016-11-17,1,"On the origin of the Schechter-like mass function of young star clusters in disk galaxies The mass function of freshly formed star clusters is empirically often described as a power law. However the cluster mass function of populations of young clusters over the scale of a galaxy has been found to be described by a Schechter-function. Here we address this apparent discrepancy. We assume that in an annulus of an isolated self- regulated radially-exponential axially-symmetric disk galaxy, the local mass function of very young (embedded) clusters is a power law with an upper mass limit which depends on the local star formation rate density. Radial integration of this mass function yields a galaxy-wide embedded cluster mass function. This integrated embedded cluster mass function has a Schechter-type form, which results from the addition of many low mass clusters forming at all galactocentric distances and rarer massive clusters only forming close to the center of the galaxy."
2016-12-02,1,"The Hubble Space Telescope UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters. VIII. Preliminary Public Catalog Release The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters (GO-13297) has been specifically designed to complement the existing F606W and F814W observations of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Globular Cluster Survey (GO-10775) by observing the most accessible 47 of the previous survey's 65 clusters in three WFC3/UVIS filters F275W, F336W, and F438W. The new survey also adds super-solar metallicity open cluster NGC 6791 to increase the metallicity diversity. The combined survey provides a homogeneous 5-band data set that can be used to pursue a broad range of scientific investigations. In particular, the chosen UV filters allow the identification of multiple stellar populations by targeting the regions of the spectrum that are sensitive to abundance variations in C, N, and O. In order to provide the community with uniform preliminary catalogs, we have devised an automated procedure that performs high-quality photometry on the new UV observations (along with similar observations of seven other programs in the archive). This procedure finds and measures the potential sources on each individual exposure using library point-spread functions and cross-correlates these observations with the original ACS-Survey catalog. The catalog of 57 clusters we publish here will be useful to identify stars in the different stellar populations, in particular for spectroscopic follow-up. Eventually, we will construct a more sophisticated catalog and artificial-star tests based on an optimal reduction of the UV survey data, but the catalogs presented here give the community the chance to make early use of this HST Treasury survey."
2016-12-12,1,"Galactic structure in the outer disk: the field in the line of sight to the intermediate-age open cluster Tombaugh 1 We employ optical photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy to study a field toward the open cluster Tombaugh 1, where we identify a complex population mixture, that we describe in terms of young and old Galactic thin disk. Of particular interest is the spatial distribution of the young population, which consists of dwarfs with spectral type as early as B6, and distribute in a {\it blue plume} feature in the colour-magnitude diagram. For the first time we confirm spectroscopically that most of these stars are early type stars, and not blue stragglers nor halo/thick disk sub-dwarfs. Moreover, they are not evenly distributed along the line of sight, but crowd at heliocentric distances between 6.6 and 8.2 kpc. We compare these results with present-day understanding of the spiral structure of the Galaxy and suggest that they traces the outer arm. This range in distances challenges current Galactic models adopting a disk cut-off at 14 kpc from the Galactic center. The young dwarfs overlap in space with an older component which identifies the old Galactic thin disk. Both young and old populations are confined in space since the disk is warped at the latitude and longitude of Tombaugh~1. The main effects of the warp are that the line of sight intersects the disk and entirely crosses it at the outer arm distance, and that there are no traces of the closer Perseus arm, which would then be either un-important in this sector, or located much closer to the formal Galactic plane. We finally analysed a group of giant stars, which turn out to be located at very different distances, and to possess very different chemical properties, with no obvious relation with the other populations."
2016-12-15,1,"The young open cluster NGC 7067 using Str\""omgren photometry NGC 7067 is a young open cluster located in the direction between the first and the second Galactic quadrants and close to the Perseus spiral arm. This makes it useful for studies of the nature of the Milky Way spiral arms. Stromgren photometry taken with the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope allowed us to compute individual physical parameters for the observed stars and hence to derive cluster's physical parameters. Spectra from the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence helped to check and improve the results. We obtained photometry for 1233 stars, individual physical parameters for 515 and spectra for 9 of them. The 139 selected cluster members lead to a cluster distance of 4.4+/-0.4 kpc, with an age below log10(t(yr))=7.3 and a present Mass of 1260+/-160Msun. The morphology of the data reveals that the centre of the cluster is at (ra,dec)=(21:24:13.69,+48:00:39.2) J2000, with a radius of 6.1arcsec. Stromgren and spectroscopic data allowed us to improve the previous parameters available for the cluster in the literature."
2017-05-01,1,"Gaia Data Release 1. Open cluster astrometry: performance, limitations, and future prospects Context. The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric  Solution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides the position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated using Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. Aims: We investigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by means of the astrometric data for open clusters. Methods: Mean cluster parallax and proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations within the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the internal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects of the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of the TGAS data is assessed. Results: Values given for standard uncertainties are still inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of least squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster parallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with earlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the Pleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that discrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the cluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether those potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the clusters. Conclusions: The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters far beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership assessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows the same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly increased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.

2017-02-01,1,"Investigation of open clusters based on IPHAS and APASS survey data We adapt the classical Q-method based on a reddening-free parameter constructed from three passband magnitudes to the filter set of Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric Hα Survey and combine it with the maximum-likelihood-based cluster parameter estimator by Naylor & Jeffries (2006) to determine the extinction, heliocentric distances, and ages of young open clusters using Hαri data. The method is also adapted for the case of significant variations of extinction across the cluster field. Our technique is validated by comparing the colour excesses, distances, and ages determined in this study with the most bona fide values reported for the 18 well-studied young open clusters in the past and a fairly good agreement is found between our extinction and distance estimates and earlier published results, although our age estimates are not very consistent with those published by other authors. We also show that individual extinction values can be determined rather accurately for stars with (r - i) > 0.1. Our results open up a prospect for determining a uniform set of parameters for northern clusters based on homogeneous photometric data, and for searching for new, hitherto undiscovered open clusters."

2017-03-01,1,"The Search for Multiple Populations in Magellanic Cloud Clusters III: No evidence for Multiple Populations in the SMC cluster NGC 419 We present the third paper about our ongoing HST survey for the search  for multiple stellar populations (MPs) within Magellanic Cloud clusters. We report here the analysis of NGC 419, a $\sim 1.5$ Gyr old, massive ($\gtrsim 2 \times 10^5 \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$) star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). By comparing our photometric data with stellar isochrones, we set a limit on [N/Fe] enhancement of $\lesssim$+0.5 dex and hence we find that no MPs are detected in this cluster. This is surprising because, in the first two papers of this series, we found evidence for MPs in 4 other SMC clusters (NGC 121; Lindsay 1, NGC 339, NGC 416), aged from 6 Gyr up to $\sim 10-11$ Gyr. This finding raises the question whether age could play a major role in the MPs phenomenon. Additionally, our results appear to exclude mass or environment as the only key factors regulating the existence of a chemical enrichment, since all clusters studied so far in this survey are equally massive ($\sim 1-2 \times 10^5 \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$) and no particular patterns are found when looking at their spatial distribution in the SMC."
2017-01-01,1,"Globular cluster absolute ages from cooling brown dwarfs Globular clusters are the oldest conglomerates of stars in our Galaxy and can be useful laboratories to test theories from stellar evolution to cosmology. In this paper, we present a new method to estimate the absolute age of a globular cluster from observations of its brown dwarfs. The transition region between the end of the main sequence and the brown dwarf regime is characterized by a dearth of objects as function of magnitude. The brightest of the cooling brown dwarfs is easily identified by an increase in density in the color-magnitude diagram as you go fainter in magnitudes, and these brightest brown dwarfs get fainter with age. By identifying the brightest brown dwarfs, it is thus possible to determine the age of a globular cluster within a 1 Gyr precision with four-sigma confidence. This new method, which is independent of current methods of age estimation and which does not rely on the knowledge of the cluster's distance from Earth, will become feasible thanks to the high spatial resolution and incredible infrared sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope."
2017-02-01,1,"The $Gaia$-ESO Survey: the inner disk intermediate-age open cluster NGC 6802 Milky Way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age, chemical composition, and kinematic properties. Intermediate-age and old open clusters are less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar Galactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction inside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs) observed by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target for calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and chemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements from $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence dwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as cluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a median radial velocity of $13.6\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster members have a median radial velocity of $12.0\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median [Fe/H] of $0.10\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster members suggests an age of $0.9\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and $E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC 6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about IOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs previously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and Berkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs. These elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of cluster turn-off mass. The $\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements are also explored in a self-consistent way."
2017-02-01,1,"Candidate star clusters toward the inner Milky Way discovered on deep-stacked Ks-band images from the VVV Survey The census of star clusters in the inner Milky Way is incomplete because  of extinction and crowding. We embarked on a program to expand the star cluster list in the direction of the inner Milky Way using deep stacks of Ks-band images from the VISTA Variables in Via Lactea (VVV) Survey. We applied an automated two-step procedure to the point-source catalog derived from the deep Ks images: first, we identified overdensities of stars, and then we selected only candidate clusters with probable member stars that match an isochrone with a certain age, distance, and extinction on the color-magnitude diagram. This pilot project only investigates the cluster population in part of one VVV tile, that is, b201. We identified nine cluster candidates and estimated their parameters. The new candidates are compact with a typical radius on the sky of ~0.2--0.4 arcmin (~0.4-1.6 pc at their estimated distances). They are located at distances of ~5-14 kpc from the Sun and are subject to moderate extinction of E(B-V)=0.4-1.0 mag. They are sparse, probably evolved, with typical ages log(t/1 yr)~9. Based on the locations of the objects inside the Milky Way, we conclude that one of these objects is probably associated with the disk or halo and the remaining objects are associated with the bulge or the halo. The cluster candidates reported here push the VVV Survey cluster detection to the limit. These new objects demonstrate that the VVV survey has the potential to identify thousands of additional cluster candidates. The sub-arcsec angular resolution nd the near-infrared wavelength regimen give it a critical advantage over other surveys."
2017-02-01,1,"The age of 47Tuc from self-consistent isochrone fits to colour-magnitude diagrams and the eclipsing member V69 Our aim is to derive a self-consistent age, distance and composition for  the globular cluster $47\,$Tucanae ($47\,$Tuc; NGC104). First, we reevaluate the reddening towards the cluster resulting in a nominal $E(B-V)=0.03\pm0.01$ as the best estimate. The $T_{\rm eff}$ of the components of the eclipsing binary member V69 is found to be $5900\pm72$ K from both photometric and spectroscopic evidence. This yields a true distance modulus $(m-M)_0=13.21\pm0.06$(random)$ \pm0.03 $(systematic) to $47\,$Tuc when combined with existing measurements of V69 radii and luminosity ratio. We then present a new completely self-consistent isochrone fitting method to ground based and $\textit{HST}$ cluster colour-magnitude diagrams and the eclipsing binary member V69. The analysis suggests that the composition of V69, and by extension one of the populations of $47\,$Tuc, is given by [Fe/H]$\sim-0.70$, [O/Fe]$\sim+0.60$, and $Y\sim0.250$ on the solar abundance scale of Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval. However, this depends on the accuracy of the model $T_{\rm eff}$ scale which is 50-75 K cooler than our best estimate but within measurement uncertainties. Our best estimate of the age of $47\,$Tuc is 11.8 Gyr, with firm ($3 \sigma$) lower and upper limits of 10.4 and 13.4 Gyr, respectively, in satisfactory agreement with the age derived from the white dwarf cooling sequence if our determination of the distance modulus is adopted."
2017-02-01,1,"The not so simple globular cluster $\omega$ Cen. I. Spatial distribution of the multiple stellar populations We present a multi-band photometric catalog of $\approx$ 1.7 million  cluster members for a field of view of $\approx$ 2x2 degree across $\omega$ Cen. Photometry is based on images collected with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4m Blanco telescope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. The unprecedented photometric accuracy and field coverage allowed us for the first time to investigate the spatial distribution of $\omega$ Cen multiple populations from the core to the tidal radius, confirming its very complex structure. We found that the frequency of blue main-sequence stars is increasing compared to red main-sequence stars starting from a distance of $\approx$ 25' from the cluster center. Blue main-sequence stars also show a clumpy spatial distribution, with an excess in the North-East quadrant of the cluster pointing towards the direction of the Galactic center. Stars belonging to the reddest and faintest red-giant branch also show a more extended spatial distribution in the outskirts of $\omega$ Cen, a region never explored before. Both these stellar sub-populations, according to spectroscopic measurements, are more metal-rich compared to the cluster main stellar population. These findings, once confirmed, make $\omega$ Cen the only stellar system currently known where metal-rich stars have a more extended spatial distribution compared to metal-poor stars. Kinematic and chemical abundance measurements are now needed for stars in the external regions of $\omega$ Cen to better characterize the properties of these sub-populations."
2016-07-29,1,"A Chandra X-ray study of the young star cluster NGC 6231: low-mass population and initial mass function NGC6231 is a massive young star cluster, near the center of the Sco OB1 association. While its OB members are well studied, its low-mass population has received little attention. We present high-spatial resolution Chandra ACIS-I X-ray data, where we detect 1613 point X-ray sources. Our main aim is to clarify global properties of NGC6231 down to low masses through a detailed membership assessment, and to study the cluster stars' spatial distribution, the origin of their X-ray emission, the cluster age and formation history, and initial mass function. We use X-ray data, complemented by optical/IR data, to establish cluster membership. The spatial distribution of different stellar subgroups also provides highly significant constraints on cluster membership, as does the distribution of X-ray hardness. We perform spectral modeling of group-stacked X-ray source spectra. We find a large cluster population down to ~0.3 Msun (complete to ~1 Msun), with minimal non-member contamination, with a definite age spread (1-8 Myrs) for the low-mass PMS stars. We argue that low-mass cluster stars also constitute the majority of the few hundreds unidentified X-ray sources. We find mass segregation for the most massive stars. The fraction of circumstellar-disk bearing members is found to be ~5%. Photoevaporation of disks under the action of massive stars is suggested by the spatial distribution of the IR-excess stars. We also find strong Halpha emission in 9% of cluster PMS stars. The dependence of X-ray properties on mass, stellar structure, and age agrees with extrapolations based on other young clusters. The cluster initial mass function, computed over ~2 dex in mass, has a slope Gamma~-1.14. The total mass of cluster members above 1 Msun is 2280 Msun, and the inferred total mass is 4380 Msun. We also study the peculiar, hard X-ray spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star WR79."
2016-08-09,1,"Nine new open clusters within 500 pc from the Sun One of the results of the Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC) survey by Kharchenko et al. (2013) was the detection of a slight under-density of old (ca. 1 Gyr) clusters within the nearest kilo-parsec from the Sun. This under-density may be due to an ineffectiveness in the detection of larger structures with lower surface brightness. We report on our attempts to reveal such clusters. We derived proper motions from a combination of Tycho-2 with URAT1, and obtained a mean precision of about 1.4 mas/y per co-ordinate for 1.3 million stars north of -20 degree declination. We cut the sky into narrow proper motion slices and searched for spatial over-densities of stars in each slice. In optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams stars from over-densities were than examined to determine if they are compatible with isochrones of a cluster. We estimated the field star contamination using our data and the Besancon Galactic model.We detected 9 hitherto unknown open clusters in the vicinity of the Sun with ages between 70 Myr and 1 Gyr, and distances between 200 and 500 pc."
2016-08-10,1,"Star cluster formation in cosmological simulations. I. properties of young clusters We present a new implementation of star formation in cosmological simulations, by considering star clusters as a unit of star formation. Cluster particles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by local gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is terminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium. We test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by comparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star clusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a Schechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with observations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is $\alpha\approx 1.8-2$, while the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related trend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation rate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate that the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star formation. These bursts are often associated with major merger events. We also find that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr and decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local variations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the scatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when the instantaneous efficiency is kept constant. Comparison of the formation timescale with the observed age spread of young star clusters provides an additional important constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback schemes."
2017-02-01,1,"Gaia-ESO Survey: global properties of clusters Trumpler 14 and 16 in the Carina Nebula We present the first extensive spectroscopic study of the global  population in star clusters Trumpler~16, Trumpler~14 and Collinder~232 in the Carina Nebula, using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey, down to solar-mass stars. In addition to the standard homogeneous Survey data reduction, a special processing was applied here because of the bright nebulosity surrounding Carina stars. We find about four hundred good candidate members ranging from OB types down to slightly sub-solar masses. About one-hundred heavily-reddened early-type Carina members found here were previously unrecognized or poorly classified, including two candidate O stars and several candidate Herbig Ae/Be stars. Their large brightness makes them useful tracers of the obscured Carina population. The spectroscopically-derived temperatures for nearly 300 low-mass members allows the inference of individual extinction values, and the study of the relative placement of stars along the line of sight. We find a complex spatial structure, with definite clustering of low-mass members around the most massive stars, and spatially-variable extinction. By combining the new data with existing X-ray data we obtain a more complete picture of the three-dimensional spatial structure of the Carina clusters, and of their connection to bright and dark nebulosity, and UV sources. The identification of tens of background giants enables us also to determine the total optical depth of the Carina nebula along many sightlines. We are also able to put constraints on the star-formation history of the region, with Trumpler~14 stars found to be systematically younger than stars in other sub-clusters. We find a large percentage of fast-rotating stars among Carina solar-mass members, which provide new constraints on the rotational evolution of pre-main-sequence stars in this mass range."
2017-03-01,1,"The chemical composition of the low-mass Galactic globular cluster NGC 6362 We present chemical abundances for 17 elements in a sample of 11 red giant branch stars in NGC 6362 from UVES spectra. NGC 6362 is one of the least massive globulars where multiple populations have been detected, yet its detailed chemical composition has not been investigated so far. NGC 6362 turns out to be a metal-intermediate ([Fe/H]=-1.07\pm0.01 dex) cluster, with its \alpha- and Fe-peak elements content compatible with that observed in clusters with similar metallicity. It also displays an enhancement in its s-process element abundances. Among the light elements involved in the multiple populations phenomenon, only [Na/Fe] shows star-to-star variations, while [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] do not show any evidence for abundance spreads. A differential comparison with M4, a globular cluster with similar mass and metallicity, reveals that the two clusters share the same chemical composition. This finding suggests that NGC 6362 is indeed a regular cluster, formed from gas that has experienced the same chemical enrichment of other clusters with similar metallicity."
2017-02-01,1,"A TGAS/Gaia DR1 parallactic distance to the sigma Orionis cluster With the new Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, I derive a new parallactic distance to the young sigma Orionis open cluster, which is a cornerstone region for studying the formation and evolution of stars and substellar objects from tens of solar masses to a few Jupiter masses. I started with the list of the 46 brightest cluster stars of Caballero (2007). After identifying the 24 TGAS stars in the 30 arcmin-radius survey area and accounting for 11 FGKM-type dwarfs and giants in the fore- and background, I got a list of 13 cluster members and candidates with new parallaxes. Of them, I discarded five cluster member candidates with questionable features of youth and/or discordant parallaxes and proper motions, including a distant Herbig Ae/Be star, and proceeded with the remaining eight stars. The sigma Orionis mean heliocentric distance is d =360^{+44}_{-35} pc, which is consistent with a contemporaneous interferometric determination that concludes a two-decade dispute on the cluster distance. As a by-product, the re-classification of those five cluster member candidates, now interlopers, shows a manifest deficit of cluster stars between 1.2 and 2.1 Msol, which leaves the door open to new astrometric membership analyses with the next Gaia data releases."
2010-09,1,"The Ages of Stars A powerful, streamlined new way to search the Astrophysics Data System"
2017-03-01,1,"Absolute Ages and Distances of 22 GCs using Monte Carlo Main-Sequence Fitting The recent Gaia Data Release 1 of stellar parallaxes provides ample opportunity to find metal-poor main-sequence stars with precise parallaxes. We select 21 such stars with parallax uncertainties better than $\sigma_\pi/\pi\leq0.10$ and accurate abundance determinations suitable for testing metal-poor stellar evolution models and determining the distance to Galactic globular clusters. A Monte Carlo analysis was used, taking into account uncertainties in the model construction parameters, to generate stellar models and isochrones to fit to the calibration stars. The isochrones which fit the calibration stars best were then used to determine the distances and ages of 22 globular clusters with metallicities ranging from -2.4 dex to -0.7 dex. We find distances with an average uncertainty of 0.15 mag and absolute ages ranging from 10.8 - 13.6 Gyr with an average uncertainty of 1.6 Gyr. Using literature proper motion data we calculate orbits for the clusters finding six that reside within the Galactic disk/bulge while the rest are considered halo clusters. We find no strong evidence for a relationship between age and Galactocentric distance, but we do find a decreasing age-[Fe/H] relation."
2017-02-01,1,"Detailed abundances from integrated-light spectroscopy: Milky Way globular clusters We test the performance of our analysis technique for integrated-light  spectra by applying it to seven well-studied Galactic GCs that span a wide range of metallicities. Integrated-light spectra were obtained by scanning the slit of the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope across the half-light diameters of the clusters. We modelled the spectra using resolved HST colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), as well as theoretical isochrones, in combination with standard stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes. The abundances of Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ba were compared with literature data for individual stars in the clusters. The typical differences between iron abundances derived from our integrated-light spectra and those compiled from the literature are less than 0.1 dex. A larger difference is found for one cluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As expected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to the Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar. When using up-to-date line lists, our [Mg/Fe] ratios also agree well with literature data. Our [Na/Fe] ratios are, on average, 0.08-0.14 dex lower than average values quoted in the literature, and our [Ba/Fe] ratios may be overestimated by 0.20-0.35 dex at the lowest metallicities. We find that analyses based on theoretical isochrones give very similar results to those based on resolved CMDs. Overall, the agreement between our integrated-light abundance measurements and the literature data is satisfactory. Refinements of the modelling procedure, such as corrections for stellar evolutionary and non-LTE effects, might further reduce some of the remaining offsets."
2017-03-01,1,"FSR 1716: A new Milky Way Globular Cluster confirmed using VVV RR Lyrae stars We use deep multi-epoch near-IR images of the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) Survey to search for RR Lyrae stars towards the Southern Galactic plane. Here we report the discovery of a group of RR Lyrae stars close together in VVV tile d025. Inspection of the VVV images and PSF photometry reveals that most of these stars are likely to belong to a globular cluster, that matches the position of the previously known star cluster FSR\,1716. The stellar density map of the field yields a $>100$ sigma detection for this candidate globular cluster, that is centered at equatorial coordinates $RA_{J2000}=$16:10:30.0, $DEC_{J2000}=-$53:44:56; and galactic coordinates $l=$329.77812, $b=-$1.59227. The color-magnitude diagram of this object reveals a well populated red giant branch, with a prominent red clump at $K_s=13.35 \pm 0.05$, and $J-K_s=1.30 \pm 0.05$. We present the cluster RR Lyrae positions, magnitudes, colors, periods and amplitudes. The presence of RR Lyrae indicates an old globular cluster, with age $>10$ Gyr. We classify this object as an Oosterhoff type I globular cluster, based on the mean period of its RR Lyrae type ab, $=0.540$ days, and argue that this is a relatively metal-poor cluster with $[Fe/H] = -1.5 \pm 0.4$ dex. The mean extinction and reddening for this cluster are $A_{K_s}=0.38 \pm 0.02$, and $E(J-K_s)=0.72 \pm 0.02$ mag, respectively, as measured from the RR Lyrae colors and the near-IR color-magnitude diagram. We also measure the cluster distance using the RR Lyrae type ab stars. The cluster mean distance modulus is $(m-M)_0 = 14.38 \pm 0.03$ mag, implying a distance $D = 7.5 \pm 0.2$ kpc, and a Galactocentric distance $R_G=4.3$ kpc."
2017-03-01,1,"$\textit{Siriusly}$, a newly identified intermediate-age Milky Way stellar cluster: A spectroscopic study of $\textit{Gaia}$ 1 We confirm the reality of the recently discovered Milky Way stellar  cluster $\textit{Gaia}$ 1 using spectra acquired with the HERMES and AAOmega spectrographs of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This cluster had been previously undiscovered due to its close angular proximity to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky at visual wavelengths. Our observations identified 41 cluster members, and yielded an overall metallicity of [Fe/H]$=-0.13\pm0.13$ and barycentric radial velocity of $v_r=58.30\pm0.22$ km/s. Isochrone fits to $\textit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 photometry indicate that $\textit{Gaia}$ 1 is likely an intermediate age ($\sim3$ Gyr) stellar cluster. Combining the positional and kinematic information we estimated an orbit with maximum height out of the Galactic plane of $z_\textrm{max}=1.7^{+2.1}_{-0.9}$ kpc and an eccentricity of $e=0.3\pm0.2$. These orbital properties suggest that it may be of an extragalactic origin, or be the result of an older cluster interacting with high altitude gas, which triggered star formation."
2014-06-01,1,"Accurate age determinations of several nearby open clusters containing magnetic Ap stars Context. To study the time evolution of magnetic fields, chemical  abundance peculiarities, and other characteristics of magnetic Ap and Bp stars during their main sequence lives, a sample of these stars in open clusters has been obtained, as such stars can be assumed to have the same ages as the clusters to which they belong. However, in exploring age determinations in the literature, we find a large dispersion among different age determinations, even for bright, nearby clusters.  Aims: Our aim is to obtain ages that are as accurate as possible for the seven nearby open clusters α Per, Coma Ber, IC 2602, NGC 2232, NGC 2451A, NGC 2516, and NGC 6475, each of which contains at least one magnetic Ap or Bp star. Simultaneously, we test the current calibrations of Te and luminosity for the Ap/Bp star members, and identify clearly blue stragglers in the clusters studied. Methods: We explore the possibility that isochrone fitting in the theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (i.e. log (L/L⊙) vs. log Te), rather than in the conventional colour-magnitude diagram, can provide more precise and accurate cluster ages, with well-defined uncertainties. Results: Well-defined ages are found for all the clusters studied. For the nearby clusters studied, the derived ages are not very sensitive to the small uncertainties in distance, reddening, membership, metallicity, or choice of isochrones. Our age determinations are all within the range of previously determined values, but the associated uncertainties are considerably smaller than the spread in recent age determinations from the literature. Furthermore, examination of proper motions and HR diagrams confirms that the Ap stars identified in these clusters are members, and that the presently accepted temperature scale and bolometric corrections for Ap stars are approximately correct. We show that in these theoretical HR diagrams blue stragglers are particularly easy to identify.  Conclusions: Constructing the theoretical HR diagram of a nearby open cluster makes possible an accurate age determination, with well defined uncertainty. This diagnostic of a cluster also provides a useful tool for studying unusual stars such as Ap stars and blue stragglers. Table 3 is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org"
2009-01-01,1,"CCD Washington photometry of three highly field star contaminated open clusters in the third Galactic quadrant We present CCD photometry in the Washington system C and T1 passbands down to T1 ˜ 19.5 magnitudes in the fields of Czernik 26, Czernik 30, and Haffner 11, three poorly studied open clusters located in the third Galactic quadrant. We measured T1 magnitudes and C - T1 colors for a total of 6472 stars distributed throughout cluster areas of 13.6‧ × 13.6‧ each. Cluster radii were estimated from star counts in appropriate-sized boxes distributed throughout the entire observed fields. Based on the best fits of isochrones computed by the Padova group to the (C - T1, T1) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), we derived color excesses, heliocentric distances and ages for the three clusters. These are characterized by a relatively small angular size and by a high field star contamination. We performed a firm analysis of the field star contamination of the CMDs and examined different relationships between the position in the Galaxy of known open clusters located within 1 kpc around the three studied ones, their age and their interstellar visual absorption. We confirm previous results in the sense that the closer the cluster birthplace to the Galactic plane, the higher the interstellar visual absorption. We also found that the space velocity dispersion perpendicular to the Galactic plane diminishes as the clusters are younger. The positions, interstellar visual absorptions, ages, and metallicities of the three studied clusters favor the hypothesis that they were not born in the recently discovered Canis major (CMa) dwarf galaxy before it was accreted by the Milky Way."
1988-03-01,1,"Intermediate-age open clusters as discriminators between overshooting and classical evolutionary models Eight intermediate-age open clusters are examined in order to compare  their color-magnitude diagrams with a set of new isochrones, derived from models in which overshooting from convective cores is taken into account. Luminosity functions and synthetic clusters are used as a needed support in the analysis. The VandenBerg's isochrones are considered to make a comparison in the classical evolutionary scheme. With the new overshooting models it is demonstrated that, in the range of age under consideration, the main-sequence gap is due only to stochastic effects or binarity. The main-sequence curvature is explained and the red giant distributions of this group of clusters as anticipated by Barbaro and Pigatto (1984) is confirmed. A best fit all over the cluster HR diagram is obtained with the isochrones and the clusters age with an uncertainty as low as 10 percent is determined."
2010-02-28,1,"A revolution in star cluster research: setting the scene Star clusters and their stellar populations play a significant role in the context of galaxy evolution, across space (from local to high redshift) and time (from currently forming to fossil remnants). We are now within reach of answering a number of fundamental questions that will have a significant impact on our understanding of key open issues in contemporary astrophysics, ranging from the formation, assembly and evolution of galaxies to the details of the star-formation process. Our improved understanding of the physics driving star cluster formation and evolution has led to the emergence of crucial new open questions that will most probably be tackled in a systematic way in the next decade."
2016-12-18,1,"Insights into the chemical composition of the metal-poor Milky Way halo globular cluster NGC 6426 We present our detailed spectroscopic analysis of the chemical composition of four red giant stars in the halo globular cluster NGC 6426. We obtained high-resolution spectra using the Magellan2/MIKE spectrograph, from which we derived equivalent widths and subsequently computed abundances of 24 species of 22 chemical elements. For the purpose of measuring equivalent widths, we developed a new semi-automated tool, called EWCODE. We report a mean Fe content of [Fe/H] = -2.34$\pm$0.05 dex (stat.) in accordance with previous studies. At a mean $\alpha$-abundance of [(Mg,Si,Ca)/3 Fe] = 0.39$\pm$0.03 dex, NGC 6426 falls on the trend drawn by the Milky Way halo and other globular clusters at comparably low metallicities. The distribution of the lighter $\alpha$-elements as well as the enhanced ratio [Zn/Fe] = 0.39 dex could originate from hypernova enrichment of the pre-cluster medium. We find tentative evidence for a spread in the elements Mg, Si, and Zn, indicating an enrichment scenario, where ejecta of evolved massive stars of a slightly older population polluted a newly born younger one. The heavy element abundances in this cluster fit well into the picture of metal-poor globular clusters, which in that respect appear to be remarkably homogeneous. The pattern of the neutron-capture elements heavier than Zn point towards an enrichment history governed by the r-process with only little -if any- sign of s-process contributions. This finding is supported by the striking similarity of our program stars to the metal-poor field star HD 108317."
2016-12-17,1,"A spectroscopic study of the open cluster NGC 6250 We present the chemical abundance analysis of 19 upper main-sequence stars of the young open cluster NGC 6250 (log t ~ 7.42 yr). This work is part of a project aimed at setting observational constraints on the theory of atomic diffusion in stellar photospheres, by means of a systematic study of the abundances of the chemical elements of early F-, A- and late B-type stars of well-determined age. Our data set consists of low-, medium- and high-resolution spectra obtained with the Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) instrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). To perform our analysis, we have developed a new suite of software tools for the chemical abundance analysis of stellar photospheres in local thermodynamical equilibrium. Together with the chemical composition of the stellar photospheres, we have provided new estimates of the cluster mean radial velocity, proper motion, refined the cluster membership, and we have given the stellar parameters including masses and fractional age. We find no evidence of statistically significant correlation between any of the parameters, including abundance and cluster age, except perhaps for an increase in Ba abundance with cluster age. We have proven that our new software tool may be successfully used for the chemical abundance analysis of large data sets of stellar spectra."
2016-12-01,1,"A comprehensive photometric study of dynamically evolved small van den Bergh-Hagen open clusters We present results from Johnson UBV, Kron-Cousins RI and Washington  CT1T2 photometries for seven van den Bergh-Hagen (vdBH) open clusters, namely, vdBH 1, 10, 31, 72, 87, 92, and 118. The high-quality, multiband photometric data sets were used to trace the cluster stellar density radial profiles and to build colour-magnitude diagrams and colour-colour diagrams from which we estimated their structural parameters and fundamental astrophysical properties. The clusters in our sample cover a wide age range, from ˜60 Myr up to 2.8 Gyr, are of relatively small size (˜1-6 pc) and are placed at distances from the Sun which vary between 1.8 and 6.3 kpc, respectively. We also estimated lower limits for the cluster present-day masses as well as half-mass relaxation times (tr). The resulting values in combination with the structural parameter values suggest that the studied clusters are in advanced stages of their internal dynamical evolution (age/tr ˜ 20-320), possibly in the typical phase of those tidally filled with mass segregation in their core regions. Compared to open clusters in the solar neighbourhood, the seven vdBH clusters are within more massive (˜80-380 M⊙), with higher concentration parameter values (c ˜ 0.75-1.15) and dynamically evolved ones."
2016-10-14,1,"WIYN Open Cluster Study. LXXII. A uvbyCa Hbeta CCD Analysis of the Metal-Deficient Open Cluster, NGC 2506 Precision uvbyCa Hbeta photometry of the metal-deficient, old open cluster, NGC 2506, is presented. The survey covers an area 20 by 20 arcminutes, and extends to V~18 for b-y and Hbeta and to V~17.0 for c_1 and hk. For V < 16.0, photometric scatter among the indices leads to the recovery of 6 known variables within the cluster core and 5 new variables in the outer 5 arcmin of the survey field. Proper motions, radial velocities, and precise multicolor indices are used to isolate a highly probable sample of cluster members from the very rich color-magnitude diagram (CMD). From 257 highly probable members at the cluster turnoff, we derive a reddening estimate of E(b-y) = 0.042 +/- 0.001 (E(B-V) = 0.058 +/- 0.001), where the errors refer to the internal standard errors of the mean. [Fe/H] is derived from the A/F dwarf members using both m_1 and hk, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.296 +/- 0.011 (sem) and -0.317 +/- 0.004 (sem), respectively. The weighted average, heavily dominated by hk, is [Fe/H] = -0.316 +/- 0.033. Based upon red giant members, we place an upper limit of +/- 0.010 on the variation in the reddening across the face of the cluster. We also identify two dozen potential red giant cluster members outside the cluster core. Victoria-Regina isochrones on the Stromgren system produce an excellent match to the cluster for an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 12.75 +/- 0.1 and an age of 1.85 +/- 0.05 Gyr."
2016-09-06,1,"Young Stellar Clusters Containing Massive Young Stellar Objects in the VVV Survey The purpose of this research is to study the connection of global properties of eight young stellar clusters projected in the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO Large Public Survey disk area and their young stellar object population. The analysis in based on the combination of spectroscopic parallax-based reddening and distance determinations with main sequence and pre-main sequence ishochrone fitting to determine the basic parameters (reddening, age, distance) of the sample clusters. The lower mass limit estimations show that all clusters are low or intermediate mass (between 110 and 1800 Mo), the slope Gamma of the obtained present-day mass functions of the clusters is close to the Kroupa initial mass function. On the other hand, the young stellar objects in the surrounding cluster's fields are classified by low resolution spectra, spectral energy distribution fit with theoretical predictions, and variability, taking advantage of multi-epoch VVV observations. All spectroscopically confirmed young stellar objects (except one) are found to be massive (more than 8 Mo). Using VVV and GLIMPSE color-color cuts we have selected a large number of new young stellar object candidates, which are checked for variability and 57% are found to show at least low-amplitude variations. In few cases it was possible to distinguish between YSO and AGB classification on the basis of the light curves."
2016-08-10,1,"The ACS Fornax Cluster Survey. XII. Diffuse Star Clusters in Early-type Galaxies Diffuse star clusters (DSCs) are old and dynamically hot stellar systems that have lower surface brightness and more extended morphology than globular clusters (GCs). Using the images from HST/ACS Fornax Cluster Survey, we find that 12 out of 43 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Fornax cluster host significant numbers of DSCs. Together with literature data from the HST/ACS Virgo Cluster Survey, where 18 out of 100 ETGs were found to host DSCs, we systematically study the relationship of DSCs with GCs, and their host galaxy environment. Two DSC hosts are post-merger galaxies, with most of the other hosts either having low mass or showing clear disk components. We find that while the number ratio of DSCs to GCs is nearly constant in massive galaxies, the DSC-to-GC ratio becomes systematically higher in lower mass hosts. This suggests that DSCs may be more efficient at forming (or surviving) in low density environments. DSC hosts are not special either in their position in the cluster, or in the galactic color-magnitude diagram. Why some disk and low-mass galaxies host DSCs while others do not is still a puzzle, however. The mean ages of DSC hosts and non-hosts are similar at similar masses, implying that formation efficiency, rather than survival, is the reason behind different DSC number fractions in early-type galaxies."
2017-02-01,1,"The Gaia-ESO Survey: the present-day radial metallicity distribution of the Galactic disc probed by pre-main-sequence clusters The radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc represents  a crucial constraint for modelling disc formation and evolution. Open clusters allow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and its evolution over time. In this paper we perform the first investigation of the present-day radial metallicity distribution based on [Fe/H] determinations in late type members of pre-main-sequence clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters are therefore essential for tracing the current inter-stellar medium metallicity. We used the products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young regions (age<100 Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc. For the first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions farther than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through samples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership analysis is discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters (Chamaeleon I and Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in our previous works. All the pre-main-sequence clusters considered in this paper have close-to-solar or slightly sub-solar metallicities. The radial metallicity distribution traced by these clusters is almost flat, with the innermost star forming regions having [Fe/H] values that are 0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older clusters located at similar Galactocentric radii. This homogeneous study of the present-day radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc favours models that predict a flattening of the radial gradient over time. On the other hand, the decrease of the average [Fe/H] at young ages is not easily explained by the models. Our results reveal a complex interplay of several processes (e.g. star formation activity, initial mass function, supernova yields, gas flows) that controlled the recent evolution of the Milky Way."
2017-05-01,1,"A Tale of Three Cities: OmegaCAM discovers multiple sequences in the color-magnitude diagram of the Orion Nebula Cluster As part of the Accretion Discs in H$\alpha$ with OmegaCAM (ADHOC)  survey, we imaged in r, i and H-alpha a region of 12x8 square degrees around the Orion Nebula Cluster. Thanks to the high-quality photometry obtained, we discovered three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram. The populations are all concentrated towards the cluster's center. Although several explanations can be invoked to explain these sequences we are left with two competitive, but intriguing, scenarios: a population of unresolved binaries with an exotic mass ratio distribution or three populations with different ages. Independent high-resolution spectroscopy supports the presence of discrete episodes of star formation, each separated by about a million years. The stars from the two putative youngest populations rotate faster than the older ones, in agreement with the evolution of stellar rotation observed in pre-main sequence stars younger than 4 Myr in several star forming regions. Whatever the final explanation, our results prompt for a revised look at the formation mode and early evolution of stars in clusters."
2017-06-01,1,"On the assessment of the nature of open star clusters and the determination of their basic parameters with limited data Our knowledge of stellar evolution and of the structure and chemical  evolution of the Galactic disk largely builds on the study of open star clusters. Because of their crucial role in these relevant topics, large homogeneous catalogues of open cluster parameters are highly desirable. Although efforts have been made to develop automatic tools to analyse large numbers of clusters, the results obtained so far vary from study to study, and sometimes are very contradictory when compared to dedicated studies of individual clusters. In this work we highlight the common causes of these discrepancies for some open clusters, and show that at present dedicated studies yield a much better assessment of the nature of star clusters, even in the absence of ideal data-sets. We make use of deep, wide-field, multi-colour photometry to discuss the nature of six strategically selected open star clusters: Trumpler~22, Lynga~6, Hogg~19, Hogg~21, Pismis~10 and Pismis~14. We have precisely derived their basic parameters by means of a combination of star counts and photometric diagrams. Trumpler~22 and Lynga~6 are included in our study because they are widely known, and thus provided a check of our data and methodology. The remaining four clusters are very poorly known, and their available parameters have been obtained using automatic tools only. Our results are in some cases in severe disagreement with those from automatic surveys."
2016-10-16,1,"Dynamical analysis of NGC 110: cluster of fainter stars or data fluctuation? The stellar enhancement of the cluster NGC 110 is investigated in various optical and infrared (IR) bands. The radial density profile of the IR region does not show a stellar enhancement in the central region of the cluster. This stellar deficiency may be occurring by undetected fainter stars due to the contamination effect of massive stars. Since, our analysis is not indicating the stellar enhancement below 16.5 mag of I band, therefore the cluster is assumed to be a group of fainter stars. The proposed magnitude scatter factor would be an excellent tool to understand the characteristic of colour-scattering of stars. The most probable members do not coincide with the model isochronic fitting in the optical bands due to poor data quality of P P MXL catalogue. The different values of the mean proper motions are found for the fainter stars of the cluster and field regions, whereas similar values are obtained for radial zones of the cluster. The symmetrical distribution of fainter stars of the core are found around the best solution of isochrone. The mass function and mass segregation studies are not possible due to higher uncertainty of the photometric data. The number of the massive stars of the cluster region is low in comparison with the field region due to completed evolution life of the massive stars."
2016-06-28,1,"CCD UBV Photometry and Kinematics of the Open Cluster NGC 225 We present the results of CCD $UBV$ photometric and spectroscopic observations of the open cluster NGC 225. In order to determine the structural parameters of NGC 225, we calculated the stellar density profile in the cluster's field. We estimated the probabilities of the stars being physical members of the cluster using the existing astrometric data. The most likely members of the cluster were used in the determination of the astrophysical parameters of the cluster. We calculated the mean radial velocity of the cluster as $V_{r}=-8.3\pm 5.0$ km s$^{-1}$ from the optical spectra of eight stars in the cluster's field. Using the U-B vs B-V two-colour diagram and UV excesses of the F-G type main-sequence stars, the reddening and metallicity of NGC 225 were inferred as $E(B-V)=0.151\pm 0.047$ mag and $[Fe/H]=-0.11\pm 0.01$ dex, respectively. We fitted the colour-magnitude diagrams of NGC 225 with the PARSEC isochrones and derived the distance modulus, distance and age of the cluster as $\mu_{V}=9.3\pm 0.07$ mag, d=585$\pm$20 pc and $t=900\pm 100$ Myr, respectively. We also estimated the galactic orbital parameters and space velocity components of the cluster and found that the cluster has a slightly eccentric orbit of $e=0.07\pm 0.01$ and an orbital period of $P_{orb}= 255\pm 5$ Myr."
2016-06-29,1,"Lost and found: evidence of Second Generation stars along the Asymptotic Giant Branch of the globular cluster NGC 6752 We derived chemical abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg and Al in 20 asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752. All these elements (but Mg) show intrinsic star-to-star variations and statistically significant correlations or anticorrelations analogous to those commonly observed in red giant stars of globular clusters hosting multiple populations. This demonstrates that, at odds with previous findings, both first and second generation stars populate the AGB of NGC 6752. The comparison with the Na abundances of red giant branch stars in the same cluster reveals that second generation stars (with mild Na and He enrichment) do reach the AGB phase. The only objects that are not observed along the AGB of NGC 6752 are stars with extreme Na enhancement. This is also consistent with standard stellar evolution models, showing that highly Na and He enriched stars populate the bluest portion of the horizontal branch and, because of their low stellar masses, evolve directly to the white dwarf cooling sequence, skipping the AGB phase."
2016-06-30,1,"Clusters: age scales for stellar physics Ages are key to truly understand a large plethora of astrophysical phenomena. On the other hand, stellar clusters are open windows to understand stellar evolution, specifically, the change with time and mass of different stellar properties. As such, they are our laboratories where different theories can be tested, but without accurate ages, our knowledge would impaired. We revisit here a large number of age-dating techniques and discuss their advantages and draw-backs. In addition, a step-by step process is suggested in order to built a coherent age scale ladder, minimizing the error budget and the sources of uncertainty."
2016-06-30,1,"Young Massive Clusters: Their Population Properties, Formation and Evolution, and Their Relation to the Ancient Globular Clusters This review summarises the main properties of Young Massive Clusters (YMCs), including their population properties, particularly focusing on extragalactic cluster samples. We discuss potential biases and caveats that can affect the construction of cluster samples and how incompleteness effects can result in erroneous conclusions regarding the long term survival of clusters. In addition to the luminosity, mass and age distributions of the clusters, we discuss the size distribution and profile evolution of the clusters. We also briefly discuss the stellar populations within YMCs. The final part of the review focusses on the connections between YMCs and the ancient globular clusters, whether or not they are related objects and how we can use what we know about YMC formation and evolution to understand how GCs formed in the early universe and how they relate to galaxy formation/evolution."
2016-06-30,1,"Open clusters and associations in the Gaia era Open clusters and associations are groups of young stars, respectively bound and unbound, that share the same origin and disperse over time into the galactic field. As such, their formation and evolution are the key to understand the origin and properties of galactic stellar populations. Moreover, since their members have about the same age, they are ideal laboratories to study the properties of young stars and constrain stellar evolution theories. In this contribution, I present our current knowledge on open clusters and associations. I focus on the methods used to derive the statistical properties (IMF, spatial distribution, IMF) of young stars and briefly discuss how they depend on the environment. I then describe how open clusters can be used as probes to investigate the structure, dynamics and chemical composition of the Milky Way. I conclude by presenting the Gaia mission and discuss how it will revolutionize this field of research."
2016-07-19,1,"Multiple populations in the old and massive Small Magellanic Cloud globular cluster NGC121 We used a combination of optical and near-UV Hubble Space Telescope photometry and FLAMES/ESO-VLT high-resolution spectroscopy to characterize the stellar content of the old and massive globular cluster (GC) NGC121 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We report on the detection of multiple stellar populations, the first case in the SMC stellar cluster system. This result enforces the emerging scenario in which the presence of multiple stellar populations is a distinctive-feature of old and massive GCs regardless of the environment, as far as the light element distribution is concerned. We find that second population (SG) stars are more centrally concentrated than first (FG) ones. More interestingly, at odds with what typically observed in Galactic GCs, we find that NGC121 is the only cluster so far to be dominated by FG stars that account for more than 65% of the total cluster mass. In the framework where GCs were born with a 90-95% of FG stars, this observational finding would suggest that either NGC121 experienced a milder stellar mass-loss with respect to Galactic GCs or it formed a smaller fraction of SG stars."
2016-07-15,1,"Extinction law in the range 0.4-4.8 $\mu$m and the 8620 \AA DIB towards the stellar cluster Westerlund 1 The young stellar cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1: $l$=339.6$^\circ$, b=$-$0.4$^\circ$) is one of the most massive in the local Universe, but accurate parameters are pending on better determination of its extinction and distance. Based on our photometry and data collected from other sources, we have derived a reddening law for the cluster line-of-sight representative of the Galactic Plane (-5$^\circ<$b$<$+5$^\circ$) in the window 0.4-4.8 $\mu$m: The power law exponent $\alpha$=2.13$\pm$0.08 is much steeper than those published a decade ago (1.6-1.8) and our index $R_V$=2.50$\pm$0.04 also differs from them, but in very good agreement with recent works based on deep surveys in the inner Galaxy. As a consequence, the total extinction $A_{Ks}$=0.74$ \pm $0.08 ($A_V$=11.40$ \pm$ 2.40) is substantially smaller than previous results(0.91-1.13), part of which ($A_{Ks}$=0.63 or $A_V$=9.66) is from the ISM. The extinction in front of the cluster spans a range of $A_V\sim$8.7 with a gradient increasing from SW to NE across the cluster face, following the same general trend of warm dust distribution. The map of the $J-Ks$ colour index also shows a trend of reddening in this direction. We measured the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 8620 \AA (the ""GAIA DIB"") for Wd 1 cluster members and derived the relation $A_{Ks}$=0.612 $EW$ $-$ 0.191 $EW^2$. This extends the Munari et al. (2008) relation, valid for $E_{B-V}$ $<$ 1, to the non-linear regime ($A_V$ $>$ 4)."
2016-07-12,1,"Star Cluster Formation and Destruction in the Merging Galaxy NGC 3256 We use the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope to study the rich population of young massive star clusters in the main body of NGC 3256, a merging pair of galaxies with a high star formation rate (SFR) and SFR per unit area ($\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$). These clusters have luminosity and mass functions that follow power laws, $dN/dL \propto L^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = -2.23 \pm 0.07$, and $dN/dM \propto M^{\beta}$ with $\beta = -1.86 \pm 0.34$ for $\tau < 10$ Myr clusters, similar to those found in more quiescent galaxies. The age distribution can be described by $dN/d\tau \propto \tau ^ \gamma$, with $\gamma \approx -0.67 \pm 0.08$ for clusters younger than about a few hundred million years, with no obvious dependence on cluster mass. This is consistent with a picture where $\sim 80 \%$ of the clusters are disrupted each decade in time. We investigate the claim that galaxies with high $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ form clusters more efficiently than quiescent systems by determining the fraction of stars in bound clusters ($\Gamma$) and the CMF/SFR statistic (CMF is the cluster mass function) for NGC 3256 and comparing the results with those for other galaxies. We find that the CMF/SFR statistic for NGC 3256 agrees well with that found for galaxies with $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ and SFRs that are lower by $1-3$ orders of magnitude, but that estimates for $\Gamma$ are only robust when the same sets of assumptions are applied. Currently, $\Gamma$ values available in the literature have used different sets of assumptions, making it more difficult to compare the results between galaxies."
2016-11-02,1,"The Gaia-ESO Survey: the inner disk, intermediate-age open cluster Trumpler 23 Context: Trumpler 23 is a moderately populated, intermediate-age open cluster within the solar circle at a Rgc ~6 kpc. It is in a crowded field very close to the Galactic plane and the color-magnitude diagram shows significant field contamination and possible differential reddening; it is a relatively understudied cluster for these reasons, but its location makes it a key object for determining Galactic abundance distributions. Aims: New data from the Gaia-ESO Survey enable the first ever radial velocity and spectroscopic metallicity measurements for this cluster. We aim to use velocities to isolate cluster members, providing more leverage for determining cluster parameters. Methods: Gaia-ESO Survey data for 167 potential members have yielded radial velocity measurements, which were used to determine the systemic velocity of the cluster and membership of individual stars. Atmospheric parameters were also used as a check on membership when available. Literature photometry was used to re-determine cluster parameters based on radial velocity member stars only; theoretical isochrones are fit in the V, V-I diagram. Cluster abundance measurements of ten radial-velocity member stars with high-resolution spectroscopy are presented for 24 elements. These abundances have been compared to local disk stars, and where possible placed within the context of literature gradient studies. Results: We find Trumpler 23 to have an age of 0.80 +/- 0.10 Gyr, significant differential reddening with an estimated mean cluster E(V-I) of 1.02 +0.14/-0.09, and an apparent distance modulus of 14.15 +/- 0.20. We find an average cluster metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.14 +/- 0.03 dex, a solar [alpha/Fe] abundance, and notably subsolar [s-process/Fe] abundances."
2015-09-14,1,"Open cluster Dolidze 25: Stellar parameters and the metallicity in the Galactic Anticentre The young open cluster Dolidze 25, in the direction of the Galactic Anticentre, has been attributed a very low metallicity, with typical abundances between $-0.5$ and $-0.7$ dex below solar. We intend to derive accurate cluster parameters and accurate stellar abundances for some of its members. We have obtained a large sample of intermediate- and high-resolution spectra for stars in and around Dolidze 25. We used the FASTWIND code to generate stellar atmosphere models to fit the observed spectra. We derive stellar parameters for a large number of OB stars in the area, and abundances of oxygen and silicon for a number of stars with spectral types around B0. We measure low abundances in stars of Dolidze 25. For the three stars with spectral types around B0, we find $0.3$ dex (Si) and $0.5$ dex (O) below the values typical in the solar neighbourhood. These values, even though not as low as those given previously, confirm Dolidze 25 and the surrounding H II region Sh2-284 as the most metal-poor star-forming environment known in the Milky Way. We derive a distance $4.5\pm0.3\:$kpc to the cluster ($r_{\textrm{G}}\approx12.3\:$kpc). The cluster cannot be older than $\sim3\:$Myr, and likely is not much younger. One star in its immediate vicinity, sharing the same distance, has Si and O abundances at most $0.15\:$dex below solar. The low abundances measured in Dolidze 25 are compatible with currently accepted values for the slope of the Galactic metallicity gradient, if we take into account that variations of at least $\pm0.15\:$dex are observed at a given radius. The area traditionally identified as Dolidze 25 is only a small part of a much larger star-forming region that comprises the whole dust shell associated with Sh2-284 and very likely several other smaller H II regions in its vicinity."
2016-06-28,1,"Could Segue 1 be a destroyed star cluster? - a dynamical perspective We attempt to find a progenitor for the ultra-faint object Segue 1 under the assumption that it formed as a dark matter free star cluster in the past. We look for orbits, using the elongation of Segue 1 on the sky as a tracer of its path. Those orbits are followed backwards in time to find the starting points of our N-body simulations. The successful orbit, with which we can reproduce Segue 1 has a proper motion of mu_alpha = -0.19 mas/yr and mu_delta = -1.9 mas/yr, placing Segue 1 near its apo-galacticon today. Our best fitting model has an initial mass of 6224 Msun and an initial scale-length of 5.75 pc."
2016-10-06,1,"On the determination of the He abundance distribution in globular clusters from the width of the main sequence One crucial piece of information to study the origin of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, is the range of initial helium abundances $\Delta{Y}$ amongst the sub-populations hosted by each cluster. These estimates are commonly obtained by measuring the width in colour of the unevolved main sequence in an optical colour-magnitude-diagram. The measured colour spread is then compared with predictions from theoretical stellar isochrones with varying initial He abundances, to determine $\Delta{Y}$. The availability of UV/optical magnitudes thanks to the {\sl HST UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs} project, will allow the homogeneous determination of $\Delta{Y}$ for a large Galactic globular cluster sample. From a theoretical point of view, accurate UV CMDs can efficiently disentangle the various sub-populations, and main sequence colour differences in the ACS $F606W-(F606W-F814W)$ diagram allow an estimate of $\Delta{Y}$. We demonstrate that from a theoretical perspective the ($F606W-F814W$) colour is an extremely reliable He-abundance indicator. The derivative d$Y$/d($F606W-F814W$), computed at a fixed luminosity along the unevolved main sequence, is largely insensitive to the physical assumptions made in stellar model computations, being more sensitive to the choice of the bolometric correction scale, and is only slightly dependent on the adopted set of stellar models. From a theoretical point of view the ($F606W-F814W$) colour width of the cluster main sequence is therefore a robust diagnostic of the $\Delta{Y}$ range."
2016-10-04,1,"Investigation of Galactic open cluster remnants: the case of NGC 7193 Galactic open clusters (OCs) that survive the early gas-expulsion phase are gradually destroyed over time by the action of disruptive dynamical processes. Their final evolutionary stages are characterized by a poorly populated concentration of stars called open cluster remnant (OCR). This study is devoted to assess the real physical nature of the OCR candidate NGC 7193. GMOS/Gemini spectroscopy of 53 stars in the inner target region were obtained to derive radial velocities and atmospheric parameters. We also employed photometric and proper motion data. The analysis method consists of the following steps: (i) analysis of the statistical resemblance between the cluster and a set of field samples with respect to the sequences defined in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs); (ii) a 5-dimensional iteractive exclusion routine was employed to identify outliers from kinematical and positional data; (iii) isochrone fitting to the $K_{s}\times(J-K_{s})$ CMD of the remaining stars and the dispersion of spectral types along empirical sequences in the $(J-H)\times(H-K_{s})$ diagram was checked. A group of stars was identified for which the mean heliocentric distance is compatible with that obtained via isochrone fitting and whose metallicities are compatible with each other. Fifteen member stars observed spectroscopically were identified together with other 19 probable members. Our results indicate that NGC 7193 is a genuine OCR, of an once very populous OC, for which the following parameters were derived: $d=501\,\pm\,46\,$pc, $t=2.5\,\pm\,1.2\,$Gyr, $\langle\,[Fe/H]\,\rangle=-0.17\,\pm\,0.23$ and $E(B-V)=0.05\,\pm\,0.05$. Its luminosity and mass functions show depletion of low mass stars, confirming the OCR dynamically evolved state."
2017-03-01,1,"Towards a comprehensive knowledge of the open cluster Haffner 9 We turn our attention to Haffner 9, a Milky Way open cluster whose previous fundamental parameter estimates are far from being in agreement. In order to provide with accurate estimates we present high-quality Washington CT1 and Johnson BVI photometry of the cluster field. We put particular care in statistically clean the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from field star contamination, which was found a common source in previous works for the discordant fundamental parameter estimates. The resulting cluster CMD fiducial features were confirmed from a proper motion membership analysis. Haffner 9 is a moderately young object (age ~ 350 Myr), placed in the Perseus arm -at a heliocentric distance of ~ 3.2 kpc-, with a lower limit for its present mass of ~ 160 Mo and of nearly metal solar content. The combination of the cluster structural and fundamental parameters suggest that it is in an advanced stage of internal dynamical evolution, possibly in the phase typical of those with mass segregation in their core regions. However, the cluster still keeps its mass function close to that of the Salpeter's law."

We corrected the photometric data for differential reddening and calculated the mean ridge line of the colour-magnitude diagrams. We compared the isochrones of Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database and PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code both with microscopic diffusion starting on the main sequence. Bracketing all previous determinations of this cluster, we tested metallicities from [Fe/H]=-1.00 to [Fe/H]=-0.50, and ages from 9 to 13 Gyr. After determining the total to selective extinction ratio only from stars belonging to this cluster, R_V=3.06+/-0.14, we found the parameters for this cluster to be E(B-V)=0.69+/-0.02(int)+/-0.04(ext), (m-M)_V=15.02+/-0.07(int)+/-0.13(ext), Age=11+/-1.15 Gyr. Evolutionary models fail to reproduce the low-Teff sequence in multiband colour-magnitude diagrams, indicating that they still have an incomplete physics. We found that the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database isochrones better fit the subgiant branch and low main sequence than the PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code."
2016-07-28,1,"The effects of individual metal contents on isochrones for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe The individual characteristics of C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe on isochrones have been investigated in this study. Stellar models have been constructed for various mixtures in which the content of each element is changed up to the extreme value reported in recent studies, and the changes in isochrone shape have been analyzed for the various mixtures. To express the abundance variation of different elements with a single parameter, we have focused on the relative changes in the total number of metal ions. A review of the shape changes revealed that Na, Mg, and Al work the same way in stellar models, as the well-known fact that C, N, and O have the same reactions in the stellar interior. In addition, it was found that in high-metallicity conditions the influence of Si and Fe on the red giant branch becomes smaller than that of Na, Mg, and Al closer to the tip. Furthermore, the influence of Fe on the main sequence is larger than that of Na, Mg, Al, and even Si."

2015-09-09,1,"Do you know the extinction in your young massive cluster? Up to ages of ~100 Myr, massive clusters are still swamped in large amounts of gas and dust, with considerable and uneven levels of extinction. At the same time, large grains (ices?) produced by type II supernovae profoundly alter the interstellar medium (ISM), thus resulting in extinction properties very different from those of the diffuse ISM. To obtain physically meaningful parameters of stars, from basic luminosities and effective temperatures to masses and ages, we must understand and measure the local extinction law. This problem affects all the massive young clusters discussed in his volume. We have developed a powerful method to unambiguously determine the extinction law in an uniform way across a cluster field, using multi-band photometry of red giant stars belonging to the red clump (RC). In the Large Magellanic Cloud, with about 20 RC stars per arcmin^2, we can easily derive a solid and self-consistent absolute extinction curve over the entire wavelength range of the photometry. Here, we present the extinction law of the Tarantula nebula (30 Dor) based on thousands of stars observed as part of the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project."
2015-09,1,"Stromgren uvby photometry of the peculiar globular cluster NGC 2419 NGC 2419 is a peculiar Galactic globular cluster in terms of size/luminosity, and chemical abundance anomalies. Here, we present Str\""omgren $uvby$ photometry of the cluster. Using the gravity- and metallicity-sensitive $c_1$ and $m_1$ indices, we identify a sample of likely cluster members extending well beyond the formal tidal radius with an estimated contamination by non-members of only 1%. We derive photometric [Fe/H] of red giants, and depending on which literature metallicity relation we use, find reasonable to excellent agreement with spectroscopic [Fe/H]. We demonstrate explicitly that the photometric errors are not Gaussian, and using a realistic model for the photometric uncertainties, find a formal internal [Fe/H] spread of $\sigma=0.11^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ dex. This is an upper limit to the cluster's true [Fe/H] spread and may partially/entirely reflect the limited precision of the photometric metallicity estimation and systematic effects. The lack of correlation between spectroscopic and photometric [Fe/H] of individual stars is further evidence against a [Fe/H] spread on the 0.1 dex level. Finally, the CN-sensitive $\delta_4$ anti-correlates strongly with Mg abundance, indicating that the 2nd generation stars are N-enriched. Absence of similar correlations in some other CN-sensitive indices supports the second generation being He-rich, which in these indices approximately compensates the shift due to CN. Compared to a single continuous distribution with finite dispersion, the observed $\delta_4$ distribution is slightly better fit by two discrete populations, with the N-enhanced stars accounting for 53$\pm$5%. NGC 2419 appears to be very similar to other metal-poor Galactic globular clusters with a similarly N-enhanced second generation and little or no variation in [Fe/H], which sets it apart from other suspected accreted nuclei such as {\omega}Cen.

2016-10-28,1,"A broad perspective on multiple abundance populations in the globular cluster NGC 1851 We present an analysis of the multiple stellar populations of the globular cluster NGC 1851. We used lower resolution spectra of giant stars to measure CN, CH, and calcium H & K spectral indices, and determine elemental abundances for carbon and nitrogen. The CN and CH indices were used to confirm that there are four populations of stars in the cluster. The primordial population of stars, with the lowest CN, was found to be generally chemically distinct in elemental abundances from the second generation populations. As expected, [N/Fe] increases with increasing CN strength, but the only other element that correlated with CN was barium. The two largest populations of stars were found to have the same rate of carbon astration as the stars ascend the giant branch. We were also able to confirm that four previously identified extratidal stars are chemically associated with the cluster. This work shows the benefit of considering the chemistry of globular clusters with both high- and low-resolution spectra."
2015-07-22,1,"Do open clusters have distinguishable chemical signatures? Past studies have already shown that stars in open clusters are chemically homogeneous (e.g. De Silva et al. 2006, 2007 and 2009). These results support the idea that stars born from the same giant molecular cloud should have the same chemical composition. In this context, the chemical tagging technique was proposed by Freeman et al. 2002. The principle is to recover disrupted stellar clusters by looking only to the stellar chemical composition. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this approach, it is necessary to test if we can distinguish between stars born from different molecular clouds. For this purpose, we studied the chemical composition of stars in 32 old and intermediate-age open clusters, and we applied machine learning algorithms to recover the original cluster by only considering the chemical signatures."
2015-01-13,1,"Star formation in the first galaxies - III. Formation, evolution, and characteristics of the first stellar cluster We simulate the formation of a low metallicity (0.01 Zsun) stellar cluster in a dwarf galaxy at redshift z~14. Beginning with cosmological initial conditions, the simulation utilizes adaptive mesh refinement and sink particles to follow the collapse and evolution of gas past the opacity limit for fragmentation, thus resolving the formation of individual protostellar cores. A time- and location-dependent protostellar radiation field, which heats the gas by absorption on dust, is computed by integration of protostellar evolutionary tracks with the MESA code. The simulation also includes a robust non-equilibrium chemical network that self-consistently treats gas thermodynamics and dust-gas coupling. The system is evolved for 18 kyr after the first protostellar source has formed. In this time span, 30 sink particles representing protostellar cores form with a total mass of 81 Msun. Their masses range from ~0.1 Msun to 14.4 Msun with a median mass ~0.5-1 Msun. Massive protostars grow by competitive accretion while lower-mass protostars are stunted in growth by close encounters and many-body ejections. In the regime explored here, the characteristic mass scale is determined by the temperature floor set by the cosmic microwave background and by the onset of efficient dust-gas coupling. It seems unlikely that host galaxies of the first bursts of metal-enriched star formation will be detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope or other next-generation infrared observatories. Instead, the most promising access route to the dawn of cosmic star formation may lie in the scrutiny of metal-poor, ancient stellar populations in the Galactic neighborhood. The observable targets that correspond to the system simulated here are ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies such as Bootes II, Segue I and II, and Willman I."
2015-07-21,1,"A comprehensive study of the open cluster NGC 6866 We present CCD $UBVRI$ photometry of the field of the open cluster NGC 6866. Structural parameters of the cluster are determined utilizing the stellar density profile of the stars in the field. We calculate the probabilities of the stars being a physical member of the cluster using their astrometric data and perform further analyses using only the most probable members. The reddening and metallicity of the cluster were determined by independent methods. The LAMOST spectra and the ultraviolet excess of the F and G type main-sequence stars in the cluster indicate that the metallicity of the cluster is about the solar value. We estimated the reddening $E(B-V)=0.074 \pm 0.050$ mag using the $U-B$ vs $B-V$ two-colour diagram. The distance modula, the distance and the age of NGC 6866 were derived as $\mu = 10.60 \pm 0.10$ mag, $d=1189 \pm 75$ pc and $t = 813 \pm 50$ Myr, respectively, by fitting colour-magnitude diagrams of the cluster with the PARSEC isochrones. The Galactic orbit of NGC 6866 indicates that the cluster is orbiting in a slightly eccentric orbit with $e=0.12$. The mass function slope $x=1.35 \pm 0.08$ was derived by using the most probable members of the cluster."
2016-06-21,1,"NGC 2548: clumpy spatial and kinematic structure in an intermediate-age galactic cluster NGC 2548 is a 400-500 Myr old open cluster with evidence of spatial substructures likely caused by its interaction with the Galactic disk. In this work we use precise astrometric data from the Carte du Ciel - San Fernando (CdC-SF) catalogue to study the clumpy structure in this cluster. We confirm the fragmented structure of NGC 2548 but, additionally, the relatively high precision of our kinematic data lead us to the first detection of substructures in the proper motion space of a stellar cluster. There are three spatially separated cores each of which has its own counterpart in the proper motion distribution. The two main cores lie nearly parallel to the Galactic plane whereas the third one is significantly fainter than the others and it moves toward the Galactic plane separating from the rest of the cluster. We derive core positions and proper motions, as well as the stars belonging to each core."
2016-01-16,1,"Million-Body Star Cluster Simulations: Comparisons between Monte Carlo and Direct $N$-body We present the first detailed comparison between million-body globular cluster simulations computed with a H\'enon-type Monte Carlo code, CMC, and a direct $N$-body code, NBODY6++GPU. Both simulations start from an identical cluster model with $10^6$ particles, and include all of the relevant physics needed to treat the system in a highly realistic way. With the two codes ""frozen"" (no fine-tuning of any free parameters or internal algorithms of the codes) we find excellent agreement in the overall evolution of the two models. Furthermore, we find that in both models, large numbers of stellar-mass black holes (> 1000) are retained for 12 Gyr. Thus, the very accurate direct $N$-body approach confirms recent predictions that black holes can be retained in present-day, old globular clusters. We find only minor disagreements between the two models and attribute these to the small-$N$ dynamics driving the evolution of the cluster core for which the Monte Carlo assumptions are less ideal. Based on the overwhelming general agreement between the two models computed using these vastly different techniques, we conclude that our Monte Carlo approach, which is more approximate, but dramatically faster compared to the direct $N$-body, is capable of producing a very accurate description of the long-term evolution of massive globular clusters even when the clusters contain large populations of stellar-mass black holes."
2015-03-10,1,"Detailed Abundances of 15 Stars in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster NGC 4833 We have observed 15 red giant stars in the relatively massive, metal-poor globular cluster NGC 4833 using the MIKE spectrograph at Magellan. We calculate stellar parameters for each star and perform a standard abundance analysis to derive abundances of 43 species of 39 elements, including 20 elements heavier than the iron group. We derive <[Fe/H]> = -2.25 +/- 0.02 from Fe I lines and <[Fe/H> = -2.19 +/- 0.013 from Fe II lines. We confirm earlier results that found no internal metallicity spread in NGC 4833, and there are no significant star-to-star abundance dispersions among any elements in the iron group (19 <= Z <= 30). We recover the usual abundance variations among the light elements C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, and possibly Si. The heavy-element distribution reflects enrichment by r-process nucleosynthesis ([Eu/Fe] = +0.36 +/- 0.03), as found in many other metal-poor globular clusters. We investigate small star-to-star variations found among the neutron-capture elements, and we conclude that these are probably not real variations. Upper limits on the Th abundance, log epsilon (Th/Eu) < -0.47 +/- 0.09, indicate that NGC 4833, like other globular clusters where Th has been studied, did not experience a so-called ""actinide boost."""

We derived the global and radial present-day mass function (MF) of the cluster and found that they are well matched by two-stage power-law relations with different slopes at different radii. The global MF of Alpha Persei shows a turnover at $m=0.62\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with low and high-mass slopes of $\alpha_\mathrm{low}=0.50\pm0.09$ ($0.1<m/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}<0.62$) and $\alpha_\mathrm{high}=2.32\pm0.14$ ($0.62\leq m/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}<4.68$) respectively. The high-mass slope of the cluster increases from $2.01$ inside $1\hbox{$.\!\!^\circ$}10$ to $2.63$ outside $2\hbox{$.\!\!^\circ$}2$, whereas the mean stellar mass decreases from $0.95$ to $0.57\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in the same regions, signifying clear evidence of mass segregation in the cluster. From an examination of the high-quality colour-magnitude data of the cluster and performing a series of Monte Carlo simulations we obtained a binary fraction of $f_{\rm bin}=34\pm12$ percent for stars with $0.70<m/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}<4.68$. This is significantly larger than the observed binary fraction, indicating that this open cluster contains a large population of unresolved binaries. Finally, we corrected the mass-function slopes for the effect of unresolved binaries and found low- and high-mass slopes of $\alpha_\mathrm{low}=0.89\pm0.11$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{high}=2.37\pm0.09$ and a total cluster mass of $352\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$."
2015-11-10,1,"The complex stellar populations in the lines of sight to open clusters in the third Galactic quadrant Multi-color photometry of the stellar populations in five fields in the third Galactic quadrant centred on the clusters NGC 2215, NGC 2354, Haffner 22, Ruprecht 11, and ESO489SC01 is interpreted in terms of a warped and flared Galactic disk, without resort to an external entity such as the popular Monoceros or Canis Major overdensities. Except for NGC 2215, the clusters are poorly or unstudied previously. The data generate basic parameters for each cluster, including the distribution of stars along the line of sight. We use star counts and photometric analysis, without recourse to Galactic-model-based predictions or interpretations, and confirms earlier results for NGC 2215 and NGC 2354. ESO489SC01 is not a real cluster, while Haffner~22 is an overlooked cluster aged about 2.5 Gyr. Conclusions for Ruprecht~11 are preliminary, evidence for a cluster being marginal. Fields surrounding the clusters show signatures of young and intermediate-age stellar populations. The young population background to NGC~2354 and Ruprecht~11 lies 8-9 kpc from the Sun and $\sim$1 kpc below the formal Galactic plane, tracing a portion of the Norma-Cygnus arm, challenging Galactic models that adopt a sharp cut-off of the disk 12-14 kpc from the Galactic center. The old population is metal poor with an age of 2-3 Gyr, resembling star clusters like Tombaugh 2 or NGC 2158. It has a large color spread and is difficult to locate precisely. Young and old populations follow a pattern that depends critically on the vertical location of the thin and/or thick disk, and whether or not a particular line of sight intersects one, both, or none."
2014-12-17,1,"The exclusion of a significant range of ages in a massive star cluster Stars spend most of their lifetimes on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The extended main-sequence turn-off regions -- containing stars leaving the main sequence after having spent all of the hydrogen in their cores -- found in massive (more than a few tens of thousands of solar masses), intermediate-age (about one to three billion years old) star clusters are usually interpreted as evidence of cluster-internal age spreads of more than 300 million years, although young clusters are thought to quickly lose any remaining star-forming fuel following a period of rapid gas expulsion on timescales of order $10^7$ years. Here we report that the stars beyond the main sequence in the two billion-year-old cluster NGC 1651, characterized by a mass of $\sim 1.7 \times 10^5$ solar masses, can be explained only by a single-age stellar population, even though the cluster has clearly extended main-sequence turn-off region. The most plausible explanation for the extended main-sequence turn-offs invokes the presence of a population of rapidly rotating stars, although the secondary effects of the prolonged stellar lifetimes associated with such a stellar-population mixture are as yet poorly understood. From preliminary analysis of previously obtained data, we find that similar morphologies are apparent in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagrams of at least five additional intermediate-age star clusters, suggesting that an extended main-sequence turn-off does not necessarily imply the presence of a significant cinternal age dispersion."
2016-06-21,1,"Study of open clusters within 1.8 kpc and understanding the Galactic structure Based on an almost complete sample of Galactic open star clusters within 1.8 kpc, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of various cluster parameters like spatial position, age, size, mass and extinction in order to understand the general properties of the open cluster system in the Galaxy and the Galactic structure. Based on the distribution of 1241 open clusters about the Galactic plane and in different age bins, we find the average Galactic scale height as Zh = 60+/-2 pc for the youngest cluster population having Age <700 Myr, however, it increases up to 64+/-2 pc when we also include older population of clusters. The solar offset is found to be 6.2+/-1.1 pc above the formal Galactic plane. We derive a local mass density of \rho_0 = 0.090+/-0.005 Msun/pc^3 and found a negligibly small amount of dark matter in the solar neighbourhood. The reddening in the direction of clusters suggests a strong correlation with their vertical distance from the Galactic plane having a respective slope of dE(B-V)/dz = 0.40+/-0.04 and 0.42+/-0.05 mag/kpc below and above the GP. We observe a linear mass-radius and mass-age relations in the open clusters and derive a slope of dR/d(logM) = 2.08+/-0.10 and d(logM)/d(logT) = -0.36+/-0.05,respectively."
2015-10-14,1,"How can young massive clusters reach their present-day sizes? The classic question that how young massive star clusters attain their shapes and sizes, as we find them today, remains to be a challenge. Both observational and computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer that massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale ($\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present study is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a filament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can expand $\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that end, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\odot-10^5 M_\odot$) are evolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the computed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared with those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\lesssim100$ Myr, in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the above compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to two-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by primordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of young massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the observed ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the expansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body calculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with $\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded cluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their consequences are discussed."
2011-12-16,1,"Strengthening the Open Cluster Distance Scale via VVV Photometry Approximately 14% of known Galactic open clusters possess absolute errors 20% as evaluated from n>3 independent distance estimates, and the statistics for age estimates are markedly worse. That impedes such diverse efforts as calibrating standard candles and constraining masses for substellar companions. New data from the VVV survey may be employed to establish precise cluster distances with comparatively reduced uncertainties (<10%). This is illustrated by deriving parameters for Pismis 19 and NGC 4349, two pertinent open clusters which hitherto feature sizable uncertainties (60%). Fundamental parameters determined for Pismis 19 from new VVV JHKs photometry are d=2.40+-0.15 kpc, <E(J-H)>=0.34+-0.04, and log(t)=9.05+-0.10, whereas for NGC 4349 the analysis yielded d=1.63+-0.13 kpc, E(J-H)=0.09+-0.02, log(t)=8.55+-0.10. The results exhibit a significant (>5x) reduction in uncertainties, and indicate that: i) existing parameters for the substellar object NGC 4349 127b require revision, in part because the new cluster parameters imply that the host is 20% less-massive (M*/Ms~3.1); ii) R Cru is not a member of NGC 4349 and should be excluded from period-Wesenheit calibrations that anchor the distance scale; iii) and results for Pismis 19 underscore the advantages gleaned from employing deep VVV JHKs data to examine obscured (Av~4) and differentially reddened intermediate-age clusters."
2016-12-29,1,"Stellar cluster candidates discovered in the Magellanic System We address the presently exciting issue of the presence of stellar clusters in the periphery of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and beyond by making use of a wealth of wide-field high-quality images released in advance from the Magellanic Stellar Hystory (SMASH) survey. We conducted a sound search for new stellar cluster candidates from suitable kernel density estimators running for appropriate ranges of radii and stellar densities. In addition, we used a functional relationship to account for the completeness of the SMASH field sample analyzed that takes into account not only the number of fields used but also their particular spatial distribution; the present sample statistically represents ~ 50$% of the whole SMASH survey. The relative small number of new stellar cluster candidates identified, most of them distributed in the outer regions of the Magellanic Clouds, might suggest that the lack of detection of a larger number of new cluster candidates beyond the main bodies of the Magellanic Clouds could likely be the outcome once the survey be completed."
2015-05-12,1,"Complex stellar system ESO65SC03: Open cluster or remnant? We present a complete spatial and dynamical study of the poorly populated stellar system ESO65SC03. The radial distribution of the system gives a core and cluster radii of 1.10+/-0.63 arcmin and 5.36+/-0.24 arcmin, respectively. The surface number density profile (SNDP) does not show any clear enhancement of the surface stellar number density between the stars of the system and the field regions. We derive the optimum isochrone solution for a particular grid size in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) using the statistical cleaning procedure. Using the statistically cleaned CMDs, we find the distance modulus, (m-M)_0, and reddening, E({B-V}), of the system to be 11.8+/-0.2 mag and 0.45 mag, respectively. The mean proper motion of this system is -5.37+/-0.81 mas/yr and 0.31+/-0.40 in RA and DEC directions, respectively. The mean proper motion of this system is found to be almost similar to the field region. The mass function for the brighter stars is found to be too high for the system to be an open cluster. These combined results place constraints on whether stellar system ESO65SC03 is a possible open star cluster remnant (POCR) or an Asterism. Our understanding is that the ESO65SC03 is in a stage of POCR by loosing their main sequence stars in the dynamic evolution processes."
2014-09-18,1,"The Panchromatic High-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Local Group  Star Clusters - I. General Data Reduction Procedures for the VLT/X-shooter  UVB and VIS arm Our dataset contains spectroscopic observations of 29 globular clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way performed with VLT/X-shooter. Here we present detailed data reduction procedures for the VLT/X-shooter UVB and VIS arm. These are not restricted to our particular dataset, but are generally applicable to different kinds of X-shooter data without major limitation on the astronomical object of interest. ESO's X-shooter pipeline (v1.5.0) performs well and reliably for the wavelength calibration and the associated rectification procedure, yet we find several weaknesses in the reduction cascade that are addressed with additional calibration steps, such as bad pixel interpolation, flat fielding, and slit illumination corrections. Furthermore, the instrumental PSF is analytically modeled and used to reconstruct flux losses at slit transit and for optimally extracting point sources. Regular observations of spectrophotometric standard stars allow us to detect instrumental variability, which needs to be understood if a reliable absolute flux calibration is desired. A cascade of additional custom calibration steps is presented that allows for an absolute flux calibration uncertainty of less than ten percent under virtually every observational setup provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. The optimal extraction increases the signal-to-noise ratio typically by a factor of 1.5, while simultaneously correcting for resulting flux losses. The wavelength calibration is found to be accurate to an uncertainty level of approximately 0.02 Angstrom. We find that most of the X-shooter systematics can be reliably modeled and corrected for. This offers the possibility of comparing observations on different nights and with different telescope pointings and instrumental setups, thereby facilitating a robust statistical analysis of large datasets.

2018-02-16,1,"MOCCA-SURVEY Database I. Unravelling black hole subsystems in globular  clusters In this paper, we show how the presence of a black hole system (BHS) at the center of a globular cluster (GC) can be inferred from observational and structural properties of the cluster. We propose a way to define the size of the BHS as the radius enclosing the same amount of mass in BHs and other stars, a definition similar to the well known concept of ""influence radius"". The BHS defined this way has properties that tightly relate with the global GC properties. We found a ""fundamental plane"" connecting the BHS typical density with the GC central surface density profile, its total luminosity and its observational half-mass radius, which combined with the mass - size BHS relation can be used to calculate the properties of BHSs in observed GCs. Comparing our results with observed Milky Way GCs, we suggest that many of them likely host massive BHS comprising of a few tens to up to several hundreds of BHs. These BHS are characterised by a relatively low typical density, $\rho_\bhs \sim 10-10^5\Ms$ pc$^{-3}$ and composed of relatively massive BHs, with average masses in the range $m_\bhs = 14-22\Ms$. "
2004-10-21,1,"NGC 6791: an exotic open cluster or the nucleus of a tidally disrupted  galaxy? We report on high resolution Echelle spectroscopy of 20 giant stars in the Galactic old open clusters NGC 6791 obtained with Hydra at the WIYN telescope. High precision radial velocity allow us to isolate 15 {\it bona fide} cluster members. From 10 of them we derive a global [M/H]=+0.39$\pm$0.05. We therefore confirm that NGC 6791 is extremely metal rich, exhibits a few marginally sub-solar abundance ratios, and within the resolution of our spectra does not show evidences of spread in metal abundance. With these new data we re-derive the cluster fundamental parameters suggesting that it is about 8 Gyr old and 4.3 kpc far from the Sun. The combination of its chemical properties, age, position, and Galactic orbit hardly makes NGC 6791 a genuine Population I open cluster. We discuss possible interpretations of the cluster peculiarities suggesting that the cluster might be what remains of a much larger system, whose initial potential well could have been sufficient to produce high metallicity stars, and which has been depopulated by the tidal field of the Galaxy. Alternatively, its current properties may be explained by the perturbation of the Galactic bar on an object originated well inside the solar ring, where the metal enrichment had been very fast. "
2018-02-12,1,"Reanalysis of nearby open clusters using Gaia DR1/TGAS and HSOY Open clusters have long been used to gain insights into the structure, composition, and evolution of the Galaxy. With the large amount of stellar data available for many clusters in the Gaia era, new techniques must be developed for analyzing open clusters, as visual inspection of cluster color-magnitude diagrams is no longer feasible. An automatic tool will be required to analyze large samples of open clusters. We seek to develop an automatic isochrone-fitting procedure to consistently determine cluster membership and the fundamental cluster parameters. Our cluster characterization pipeline first determined cluster membership with precise astrometry, primarily from TGAS and HSOY. With initial cluster members established, isochrones were fitted, using a chi-squared minimization, to the cluster photometry in order to determine cluster mean distances, ages, and reddening. Cluster membership was also refined based on the stellar photometry. We used multiband photometry, which includes ASCC-2.5 BV, 2MASS JHK_s, Gaia G band. We present parameter estimates for all 24 clusters closer than 333 pc as determined by the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data and the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog. We find that our parameters are consistent to those in the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog. We demonstrate that it is feasible to develop an automated pipeline that determines cluster parameters and membership reliably. After additional modifications, our pipeline will be able to use Gaia DR2 as input, leading to better cluster memberships and more accurate cluster parameters for a much larger number of clusters. "
2005-03-25,1,"Morphology and Evolution of Simulated and Optical Clusters: A  Comparative Analysis We have made a comparative study of morphological evolution in simulated DM halos and X-ray brightness distribution, and in optical clusters. Samples of simulated clusters include star formation with supernovae feedback, radiative cooling, and simulation in the adiabatic limit at three different redshifts, z = 0.0, 0.10, and 0.25. The optical sample contains 208 ACO clusters within redshift, $z \leq 0.25$. Cluster morphology, within 0.5 and 1.0 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from cluster center, is quantified by multiplicity and ellipticity. We find that the distribution of the dark matter halos in the adiabatic simulation appear to be more elongated than the galaxy clusters. Radiative cooling brings halo shapes in excellent agreement with observed clusters, however, cooling along with feedback mechanism make the halos more flattened. Our results indicate relatively stronger structural evolution and more clumpy distributions in observed clusters than in the structure of simulated clusters, and slower increase in simulated cluster shapes compared to those in the observed one. Within $z \leq 0.1$, we notice an interesting agreement in the shapes of clusters obtained from the cooling simulations and observation. We also notice that the different samples of observed clusters differ significantly in morphological evolution with redshift. We highlight a few possibilities responsible for the discrepancy in morphological evolution of simulated and observed clusters. "
2018-02-12,1,"The emergence of the galactic stellar mass function from a non-universal  IMF in clusters We investigate how a single generation galactic mass function (SGMF) depends on the existence of variations in the initial stellar mass functions (IMF) of stellar clusters. We show that cluster-to-cluster variations of the IMF lead to a multicomponent SGMF where each component in a given mass range can be described by a distinct power-law function. We also show that a dispersion of $\approx 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ in the characteristic mass of the IMF, as observed for young Galactic clusters, leads to a low mass slope of the SGMF that matches the observed Galactic stellar mass function even when the IMFs in the low mass end of individual clusters are much steeper.

2017-01-01,1,"Extinction in the Star Cluster SAI~113 and Galactic Structure in Carina Photometric CCD {\it UBVI}$_C$ photometry obtained for 4860 stars surrounding the embedded southern cluster SAI~113 (Skiff~8) is used to examine the reddening in the field and derive the distance to the cluster and nearby van~Genderen~1. Spectroscopic color excesses for bright cluster stars, photometric reddenings for A3 dwarfs, and dereddening of cluster stars imply that the reddening and extinction laws match results derived for other young clusters in Carina: E$_{U-B}/$E$_{B-V} \simeq 0.64$ and $R_V \simeq 4$. SAI~113 displays features that may be linked to a history of dynamical interactions among member stars: possible circumstellar reddening and rapid rotation of late B-type members, ringlike features in star density, and a compact core with most stars distributed randomly across the field. The group van~Genderen~1 resembles a stellar asterism, with potential members distributed randomly across the field. Distances of $3.90 \pm0.19$ kpc and $2.49 \pm0.09$ kpc are derived for SAI~113 and van~Genderen~1, respectively, with variable reddenings E$_{B-V}$ ranging from 0.84 to 1.29 and 0.23 to 1.28. The SRC variables CK~Car and EV~Car may be outlying members of van~Genderen~1, thereby of use for calibrating the period-luminosity relation for pulsating M supergiants. More importantly, the anomalous reddening and extinction evident in Carina and nearby regions of the Galactic plane in the fourth quadrant impact the mapping of spiral structure from young open clusters. The distribution of spiral arms in the fourth quadrant may be significantly different from how it is often portrayed."
2014-09-18,1,"Dynamical friction in multi-component evolving globular clusters We use the Chandrasekhar formalism and direct N-body simulations to study the effect of dynamical friction on a test object only slightly more massive than the field stars, orbiting a spherically symmetric background of particles with a mass spectrum. The main goal is to verify whether the dynamical friction time (t_DF) develops a non-monotonic radial-dependence that could explain the bimodality of the Blue Straggler radial distributions observed in globular clusters. In these systems, in fact, relaxation effects lead to a mass and velocity radial segregation of the different mass components, so that mass-spectrum effects on t_DF are expected to be dependent on radius. We find that, in spite of the presence of different masses, t_DF is always a monotonic function of radius, at all evolutionary times and independently of the initial concentration of the simulated cluster. This because the radial dependence of t_DF is largely dominated by the total mass density profile of the background stars (which is monotonically decreasing with radius). Hence, a progressive temporal erosion of the BSS population at larger and larger distances from the cluster center remains the simplest and the most likely explanation of the shape of the observed BSS radial distributions, as suggested in previous works. We also confirm the theoretical expectation that approximating a multi-mass globular cluster as made of (averaged) equal-mass stars can lead to significant overestimates of t_DF within the half-mass radius.

1999-10-07,2,"Stellar Dynamics at the Galactic Center with an Extremely Large  Telescope We discuss experiments achievable via monitoring of stellar dynamics near the massive black hole at the Galactic center with a next generation, extremely large telescope (ELT). Given the likely observational capabilities of an ELT and current knowledge of the stellar environment at the Galactic center, we synthesize plausible samples of stellar orbits around the black hole. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to evaluate the constraints that orbital monitoring places on the matter content near the black hole. Results are expressed as functions of the number N of stars with detectable orbital motions and the astrometric precision dtheta and spectroscopic precision dv at which stellar proper motions and radial velocities are monitored. For N = 100, dtheta = 0.5 mas, and dv = 10 km/s -- a conservative estimate of the capabilities of a 30 meter telescope -- the extended matter distribution enclosed by the orbits will produce measurable deviations from Keplerian motion if >1000 Msun is enclosed within 0.01 pc. The black hole mass and distance to the Galactic center will be measured to better than ~0.1%. Lowest-order relativistic effects, such as the prograde precession, will be detectable if dtheta < 0.5 mas. Higher-order effects, including frame dragging due to black hole spin, requires dtheta < 0.05 mas, or the favorable discovery of a compact, highly eccentric orbit. Finally, we calculate the rate at which monitored stars undergo detectable nearby encounters with background stars. Such encounters probe the mass function of stellar remnants that accumulate near the black hole. We find that ~30 encounters will be detected over a 10 yr baseline for dtheta = 0.5 mas. "
2018-02-13,2,"The Milky Way Halo in Action Space We analyse the structure of the local stellar halo of the Milky Way in action space using the SDSS--Gaia catalogue. The metal-rich population is more distended towards high radial action $J_R$ as compared to azimuthal or vertical action, $J_\phi$ or $J_z$. It has a mild prograde rotation $(\langle v_\phi \rangle \approx 25$ km s$^{-1}$), is radially anisotropic and highly flattened with axis ratio $q \approx 0.6 - 0.7$. The metal-poor population is more evenly distributed in all three actions. It has larger prograde rotation $(\langle v_\phi \rangle \approx 50$ km s$^{-1}$), a mild radial anisotropy and a roundish morphology ($q\approx 0.9$). The highest energy stars are predominantly metal-rich and strongly retrograde, suggesting an origin in a retrograde encounter, possibly the one that created the stripped dwarf galaxy nucleus, $\omega$Centauri. We argue the metal-rich component is most likely built from recent accretion of a single massive dwarf galaxy. The metal-poor component may be the residue of material lost from globular clusters, or the early accretion of small dwarfs. Also visible as a distinct entity in action space is a component related to the thick disk, which is flattened and prograde. It extends over a range of metallicities down to [Fe/H] $\approx -3$. It has a net outward radial velocity $\langle v_R \rangle \approx 12$ km s$^{-1}$ within the Solar circle at $|z| <3.5$ kpc. This suggests the sculpting effect of a dynamical resonance, probably due to the Galactic bar and linked to the Hercules stream, is present at extremely low metallicities. "
2018-02-14,2,"Geometric Aspects and Testing of the Galactic Center Distance  Determination from Spiral Arm Segments We consider the problem of determining the geometric parameters of a Galactic spiral arm from its segment by including the distance to the spiral pole, i.e., the distance to the Galactic center ($R_0$). The question about the number of points belonging to one turn of a logarithmic spiral and defining this spiral as a geometric figure has been investigated numerically and analytically by assuming the direction to the spiral pole (to the Galactic center) to be known. Based on the results obtained, in an effort to test the new approach, we have constructed a simplified method of solving the problem that consists in finding the median of the values for each parameter from all possible triplets of objects in the spiral arm segment satisfying the condition for the angular distance between objects. Applying the method to the data on the spatial distribution of masers in the Perseus and Scutum arms (the catalogue by Reid et al. (2014)) has led to an estimate of $R_0 = 8.8 \pm 0.5$ kpc. The parameters of five spiral arm segments have been determined from masers of the same catalogue. We have confirmed the difference between the spiral arms in pitch angle. The pitch angles of the arms revealed by masers are shown to generally correlate with $R_0$ in the sense that an increase in $R_0$ leads to a growth in the absolute values of the pitch angles. "
2018-02-16,2,"The connection between mass, environment and slow rotation in simulated  galaxies Recent observations from integral field spectroscopy (IFS) indicate that the fraction of galaxies that are slow rotators, $F_{\rm SR}$, depends primarily on stellar mass, with no significant dependence on environment. We investigate these trends and the formation paths of slow rotators (SRs) using the EAGLE and Hydrangea hydro-dynamical simulations. EAGLE consists of several cosmological boxes of volumes up to $(100\,\rm Mpc)^3$, while Hydrangea consists of $24$ cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters and their environment. Together they provide a statistically significant sample in the stellar mass range $10^{9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}-10^{12.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, of $16,358$ galaxies. We construct IFS-like cubes and measure stellar spin parameters, $\lambda_{\rm R}$, and ellipticities, allowing us to classify galaxies into slow/fast rotators as in observations. The simulations display a primary dependence of $F_{\rm SR}$ on stellar mass, with a weak dependence on environment. At fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies are more likely to be SRs than centrals. $F_{\rm SR}$ shows a dependence on halo mass at fixed stellar mass for central galaxies, while no such trend is seen for satellites. We find that $\approx 70$% of SRs at $z=0$ have experienced at least one merger with mass ratio $\ge 0.1$, with dry mergers being at least twice more common than wet mergers. Individual dry mergers tend to decrease $\lambda_{\rm R}$, while wet mergers mostly increase it. However, $30$% of SRs at $z=0$ have not experienced mergers, and those inhabit halos with median spins twice smaller than the halos hosting the rest of the SRs. Thus, although the formation paths of SRs can be varied, dry mergers and/or halos with small spins dominate. "

2014-09-18,2,"Catalog of observed tangents to the spiral arms in the Milky Way galaxy From the sun's location in the Galactic disk, one can use different arm tracers (CO, HII, thermal or ionized or relativistic electrons, masers, cold or hot dust, etc) to locate a tangent to each spiral arm in the disk of the Milky Way galaxy. We present a Master catalog of the astronomically observed tangents to the Galaxy's spiral arms, using different arm tracers from the literature. Some arm tracers can have slightly divergent results from several papers, so a mean is taken - see Appendix for CO, HII, and masers. The Master catalog of means currently consists of 63 mean tracer entries, spread over many arms (Carina, Crux-Centaurus, Norma, Perseus origin, near 3-kpc, Scutum, Sagittarius), stemming from 107 original arm tracer entries. Additionally, we updated and revised a previous a previous statistical analysis of the angular offset and linear separation from the mid-arm, for each different mean arm tracer. Given enough arm tracers, and summing and averaging over all spiral arms, one could determine if arm tracers have separate and parallel lanes in the Milky Way. This statistical analysis allows a cross-cut of a galactic spiral arm to be made, confirming a recent discovery of a linear separation between arm tracers. Here, from the mid-arm's CO to the inner edge's hot dust, the arm half-width is about 340 parsecs; doubling would yield a full arm width of 680 parsecs. We briefly compare these observations with the predictions of many spiral arm theories, notably the density wave theory. "

However, if the system of concern is finite in size and density (not at the late stage of the evolution) one must employ the fourth effect, self-consistent $'$truncated$'$ Newtonian mean field (m.f.) potential $\Phi^{\triangle}$ $(r,t)=$ $\int_{\|r-r' \| > \triangle} \phi\left(r-r'\right)f\left(r',p',t\right)\text{d}^{3}{r'}\text{d}^{3}{p'}$. The lower limit $\triangle$ represents the smallest space scale that statistical description is applicable, corresponding to the Landau distance. The lower limit $\triangle$ represents the smallest spatial scale on which statistical descriptions are applicable, corresponding to the Landau distance. The truncated m.f. potential does not originate from the sparseness of stars in phase space but is a necessary condition to separate the collision kinetic description (close encounters) from the wave one (statistical acceleration). The present paper studies a formulation of mathematically divergence-free kinetic equations based on the truncated m.f. potential at three level. (i) No stars can come closer each other than the Landau distance. (ii) Only test star can come closer to one field star than the Landau distance at a time while the other field stars can not. (iii) A convergent kinetic theory for levels (i) and (ii) is formulated. Especially, the Kandrup's generalsied Landau equation was extended by employing the Grad's truncated distribution function and Klimontovich's theory of non-ideal systems. A correct relation is given between the strong two-body encounter and m.f. potential. "
2018-02-16,2,"Metallicity Distribution of Disk Stars and the Formation History of the  Milky Way We investigate the formation history of the stellar disk component in the Milky Way (MW) based on our new chemical evolution model. Our model considers several fundamental baryonic processes, including gas infall, re-accretion of outflowing gas, and radial migration of disk stars. Each of these baryonic processes in the disk evolution is characterized by model parameters, which are determined by fitting to various observational data of the stellar disk in the MW, including the radial dependence of the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the disk stars, which has recently been derived in the APOGEE survey. We succeeded to obtain the best set of model parameters, which well reproduces the observed radial dependences of the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the MDFs for the disk stars. We analyze the basic properties of our model results in detail to get new insights into the important baryonic processes in the formation history of the MW. One of the remarkable findings is that outflowing gas, containing much heavy elements, preferentially re-accretes onto the outer disk parts, and this recycling process of metal-enriched gas is a key ingredient to reproduce the observed narrower MDFs at larger radii. Moreover, important implications for the radial dependence of gas infall and the influence of radial migration on the MDFs are also inferred from our model calculation. Thus, the MDF of disk stars is a useful clue for studying the formation history of the MW. "
2016-08-16,2,"Bayesian Mass Estimates of the Milky Way II: The dark and light sides of parameter assumptions We present mass and mass profile estimates for the Milky Way Galaxy using the Bayesian analysis developed by Eadie et al (2015b) and using globular clusters (GCs) as tracers of the Galactic potential. The dark matter and GCs are assumed to follow different spatial distributions; we assume power-law model profiles and use the model distribution functions described in Evans et al. (1997); Deason et al (2011, 2012a). We explore the relationships between assumptions about model parameters and how these assumptions affect mass profile estimates. We also explore how using subsamples of the GC population beyond certain radii affect mass estimates. After exploring the posterior distributions of different parameter assumption scenarios, we conclude that a conservative estimate of the Galaxy's mass within 125kpc is $5.22\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$, with a $50\%$ probability region of $(4.79, 5.63) \times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Extrapolating out to the virial radius, we obtain a virial mass for the Milky Way of $6.82\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ with $50\%$ credible region of $(6.06, 7.53) \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ ($r_{vir}=185^{+7}_{-7}$kpc). If we consider only the GCs beyond 10kpc, then the virial mass is $9.02~(5.69, 10.86) \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ ($r_{vir}=198^{+19}_{-24}$kpc). We also arrive at an estimate of the velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ of the GC population, which is $\beta=0.28$ with a $50\%$ credible region (0.21, 0.35). Interestingly, the mass estimates are sensitive to both the dark matter halo potential and visible matter tracer parameters, but are not very sensitive to the anisotropy parameter."
2018-02-16,2,"Is the Milky Way still breathing? RAVE-Gaia streaming motions We use data from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution catalogue (TGAS) to compute the velocity fields yielded by the radial (VR), azimuthal (Vphi) and vertical (Vz) components of associated Galactocentric velocity. We search in particular for variation in all three velocity components with distance above and below the disc midplane, as well as how each component of Vz (line-of-sight and tangential velocity projections) modifies the obtained vertical structure. To study the dependence of velocity on proper motion and distance we use two main samples: a RAVE sample including proper motions from the Tycho-2, PPMXL and UCAC4 catalogues, and a RAVE-TGAS sample with inferred distances and proper motions from the TGAS and UCAC5 catalogues. In both samples, we identify asymmetries in VR and Vz. Below the plane we find the largest radial gradient to be dVR / dR = -7.01+- 0.61 km\s kpc, in agreement with recent studies. Above the plane we find a similar gradient with dVR / dR= -9.42+- 1.77 km\s kpc. By comparing our results with previous studies, we find that the structure in Vz is strongly dependent on the adopted proper motions. Using the Galaxia Milky Way model, we demonstrate that distance uncertainties can create artificial wave-like patterns. In contrast to previous suggestions of a breathing mode seen in RAVE data, our results support a combination of bending and breathing modes, likely generated by a combination of external or internal and external mechanisms.

2018-02-13,2,"A Multi-Frequency Study of the Milky Way-like Spiral Galaxy NGC 6744 We present a multi-frequency study of the intermediate spiral SAB(r)bc type galaxy NGC 6744, using available data from the Chandra X-Ray telescope, radio continuum data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and Murchison Widefield Array, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer infrared observations. We identify 117 X-ray sources and 280 radio sources. Of these, we find nine sources in common between the X-ray and radio catalogues, one of which is a faint central black hole with a bolometric radio luminosity similar to the Milky Way's central black hole. We classify 5 objects as supernova remnant candidates, 2 objects as likely supernova remnants, 17 as HII regions, 1 source as an AGN; the remaining 255 radio sources are categorised as background objects and one X-ray source is classified as a foreground star. We find the star-formation rate (SFR) of NGC 6744 to be in the range 2.8 - 4.7 $\rm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ signifying the galaxy is still actively forming stars. The specific SFR of NGC 6744 is greater than that of late-type spirals such as the Milky Way, but considerably less that that of a typical starburst galaxy. "
2016-08-17,2,"Red giants observed by CoRoT and APOGEE: The evolution of the Milky Way's radial metallicity gradient Using combined asteroseismic and spectroscopic observations of 418 red-giant stars close to the Galactic disc plane (6 kpc $<R_{\rm Gal}\lesssim13$ kpc, $|Z_{\rm Gal}|<0.3$ kpc), we measure the age dependence of the radial metallicity distribution in the Milky Way's thin disc over cosmic time. The radial metallicity gradient is constant, at a value of $\sim-0.07$ dex/kpc, for stellar populations younger than $\sim4$ Gyr, and flattens to reach a value of $\sim-0.02$ dex/kpc for stars with ages between 6 and 10 Gyr. After a long-lasting observational debate, our data are able to rule out certain chemical-evolution scenarios, especially models in which the radial abundance gradient flattens with time. Our results are in excellent agreement with a state-of-the-art chemo-dynamical Milky-Way model in which the evolution of the abundance gradient and its scatter can be entirely explained by a non-varying negative metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium, together with stellar radial mixing and migration. We also offer an explanation for why old open clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood can be more metal rich than young clusters: Already within 2 Gyr, radial migration can bring metal-rich clusters from the innermost regions of the disc to Galactocentric radii of 5 to 8 kpc. In the near future, asteroseismic data from the K2 mission will allow for improved statistics and a better coverage of the inner-disc regions, thereby providing tighter constraints on the evolution of the central parts of the Milky Way."
2017-07-01,2,"Search for Galactic warp signal in Gaia DR1 proper motions The nature and origin of the Galactic warp represent one of the open questions posed by Galactic evolution. Thanks to Gaia high precision absolute astrometry, steps towards the understanding of the warp's dynamical nature can be made. Indeed, proper motions for long-lived stable warp are expected to show measurable trends in the component vertical to the galactic plane. Within this context, we search for the kinematic warp signal in the first Gaia data release (DR1). By analyzing distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars in the Hipparcos subset in Gaia DR1, we find that the kinematic trends cannot be explained by a simple model of a long-lived warp. We therefore discuss possible scenarios for the interpretation of the obtained results. We also present current work in progress to select a larger sample of OB star candidates from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) subsample in DR1, and delineate the points that we will be addressing in the near future."
2016-08-22,2,"The Chemical Abundance Structure of the Inner Milky Way: A Signature of ""Upside-Down"" Disk Formation? We present a model for the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of stars in the inner Galaxy, R=3-5 kpc, measured as a function of vertical distance |z| from the midplane by Hayden et al. (2015, H15). Motivated by an ""upside-down"" scenario for thick disk formation, in which the thickness of the star-forming gas layer contracts as the stellar mass of the disk grows, we combine one-zone chemical evolution with a simple prescription in which the scale-height of the stellar distribution drops linearly from z_h=0.8 kpc to z_h=0.2 kpc over a timescale t_c, remaining constant thereafter. We assume a linear-exponential star-formation history, SFR ~ te^{-t/t_sf}. With a star-formation efficiency timescale of 2 Gyr, an outflow mass-loading factor of 1.5, t_sf=3 Gyr, and t_c=2.5 Gyr, the model reproduces the observed locus of inner disk stars in [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) measured by H15 at |z|=0-0.5 kpc, 0.5-1 kpc, and 1-2 kpc. Substantial changes to model parameters lead to disagreement with the H15 data; for example, models with t_c=1 Gyr or t_sf=1 Gyr fail to match the observed MDF at high-|z| and low-|z|, respectively. The inferred scale-height evolution, with z_h(t) dropping on a timescale t_c ~ t_sf at large lookback times, favors upside-down formation over dynamical heating of an initially thin stellar population as the primary mechanism regulating disk thickness. The failure of our short-t_c models suggests that any model in which thick disk formation is a discrete event will not reproduce the continuous dependence of the MDF on |z| found by H15. Our scenario for the evolution of the inner disk can be tested by future measurements of the |z|-distribution and the age-metallicity distribution at R=3-5 kpc."
2018-02-12,2,"Co-formation of the Galactic disc and the stellar halo Using a large sample of Main Sequence stars with 7-D measurements supplied by Gaia and SDSS, we study the kinematic properties of the local (within ~10 kpc from the Sun) stellar halo. We demonstrate that the halo's velocity ellipsoid evolves strongly with metallicity. At the low [Fe/H] end, the orbital anisotropy (the amount of motion in the radial direction compared to the tangential one) is mildly radial with 0.2<beta<0.4. However, for stars with [Fe/H]>-1.7 we measure extreme values of beta~0.9. Across the metallicity range considered, i.e. -3<[Fe/H]<-1, the stellar halo's spin is minimal, at the level of 20<v_theta (km/s) <30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of halo formation, we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent with the continuous accretion of dwarf satellites. Instead, we argue, the stellar debris in the inner halo were deposited in a major accretion event by a satellite with Mvir>10^10 Msun around the epoch of the Galactic disc formation, i.e. between 8 and 11 Gyr ago. The radical halo anisotropy is the result of the dramatic radialisation of the massive progenitor's orbit, amplified by the action of the growing disc. "

Near-IR {\it JHK$_{S}$} {\it (2MASS)} photometry has been used for getting a homogeneous Catalog of 264 open clusters' parameters, which are studied for the first time by the author through the last five years.

2018-02-12,2,"Resolving the Disc-Halo Degeneracy I: A Look at NGC 628 The decomposition of the rotation curve of galaxies into contribution from the disc and dark halo remains uncertain and depends on the adopted mass to light ratio (M/L) of the disc. Given the vertical velocity dispersion of stars and disc scale height, the disc surface mass density and hence the M/L can be estimated. We address a conceptual problem with previous measurements of the scale height and dispersion. When using this method, the dispersion and scale height must refer to the same population of stars. The scale height is obtained from near-IR studies of edge-on galaxies and is weighted towards older kinematically hotter stars, whereas the dispersion obtained from integrated light in the optical bands includes stars of all ages. We aim to extract the dispersion for the hotter stars, so that it can then be used with the correct scale height to obtain the disc surface mass density. We use a sample of planetary nebulae (PNe) as dynamical tracers in the face-on galaxy NGC 628. We extract two different dispersions from its velocity histogram -- representing the older and younger PNe. We also present complementary stellar absorption spectra in the inner regions of this galaxy and use a direct pixel fitting technique to extract the two components. Our analysis concludes that previous studies, which do not take account of the young disc, underestimate the disc surface mass density by a factor of ~ 2. This is sufficient to make a maximal disc for NGC 628 appear like a submaximal disc. "
2017-01-01,2,"The SLUGGS Survey: a catalog of over 4000 globular cluster radial velocities in 27 nearby early-type galaxies Here we present positions and radial velocities for over 4000 globular  clusters (GCs) in 27 nearby early-type galaxies from the SLUGGS survey. The SLUGGS survey is designed to be representative of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in the stellar mass range 10 $<$ log M$_{\ast}$/M$_{\odot}$ $<$ 11.7. The data have been obtained over many years, mostly using the very stable multi-object spectrograph DEIMOS on the Keck II 10m telescope. Radial velocities are measured using the calcium triplet lines with a velocity accuracy of $\pm$ 10-15 km/s. We use phase space diagrams (i.e. velocity--position diagrams) to identify contaminants such as foreground stars and background galaxies, and to show that the contribution of GCs from neighboring galaxies is generally insignificant. Likely ultra-compact dwarfs are tabulated separately. We find that the mean velocity of the GC system is close to that of the host galaxy systemic velocity, indicating that the GC system is in overall dynamical equilibrium within the galaxy potential. We also find that the GC system velocity dispersion scales with host galaxy stellar mass in a similar manner to the Faber-Jackson relation for the stellar velocity dispersion. Publication of these GC radial velocity catalogs should enable further studies in many areas, such as GC system substructure, kinematics, and host galaxy mass measurements."
2013-04-27,2,"The first Hi-GAL observations of the outer Galaxy: a look to star formation in the third Galactic quadrant in the longitude range 216.5 < l < 225.5 We present the first Herschel PACS and SPIRE photometric observations in a portion of the outer Galaxy ($216.5^{\circ} \lesssim \ell \lesssim 225.5^{\circ}$ and $-2^{\circ} \lesssim b \lesssim 0^{\circ}$) as a part of the Hi-GAL survey. The maps between 70 and 500 $\mu$m, the derived column density and temperature maps, and the compact source catalog are presented. NANTEN CO(1-0) line observations are used to derive cloud kinematics and distances, so that we can estimate distance-dependent physical parameters of the compact sources (cores and clumps) having a reliable spectral energy distribution, that we separate in 255 proto-stellar and 688 starless. Both typologies are found in association with all the distance components observed in the field, up to $\sim 5.8$ kpc, testifying the presence of star formation beyond the Perseus arm at these longitudes. Selecting the starless gravitationally bound sources we identify 590 pre-stellar candidates. Several sources of both proto- and pre-stellar nature are found to exceed the minimum requirement for being compatible with massive star formation, based on the mass-radius relation. For the pre-stellar sources belonging to the Local arm ($d\lesssim1.5$ kpc) we study the mass function, whose high-mass end shows a power-law $N(\log M) \propto M^{-1.0 \pm 0.2}$. Finally, we use a luminosity vs mass diagram to infer the evolutionary status of the sources, finding that most of the proto-stellar are in the early accretion phase (with some cases compatible with a Class I stage), while for pre-stellar sources, in general, accretion has not started yet."
2013-05-15,2,"Young Open Star Clusters: The Spatial Distribution of Metallicity in the Solar Neighborhood We perform a comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of young (<50 Myr) open star clusters and field Cepheids with different metallicities. A significant fraction of young clusters are shown to have low metallicities atypical of field Cepheids. Both types of objects exhibit approximately equal (in magnitude) negative radial metallicity gradients, while their azimuthal metallicity gradients differ outside the error limits and have opposite signs. Among the stellar complexes identified by young clusters, the most metal-poor clusters are grouped in the Perseus complex. It is the clusters of this complex that are responsible for the radial and azimuthal metallicity gradients among young clusters. The described properties are indicative of a weak mixing of interstellar matter before the onset of star formation there. Significant differences between the spatial distributions of open clusters and field stars with different metallicities suggest different conditions required for the formation of these types of objects."
2016-11-28,2,"Separation of Stellar Populations by an Evolving Bar: Implications for the Bulge of the Milky Way We present a novel interpretation of the previously puzzling different behaviours of stellar populations of the Milky Way's bulge. We first show, by means of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations with different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially cooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and peanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a vertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical, velocity dispersion that drives this evolution. Assuming that early stellar discs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random motions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density distributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a high resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate that this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show that a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics, and chemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to the formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed from a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated by the bar. For the first time we are able to account for the bulge's main trends via a model in which the bulge formed completely in situ. Since the model is generic, we also predict the general appearance of stellar population maps of external edge-on galaxies."
2013-04-11,2,"Galaxy Morphology Galaxy morphology has many structures that are suggestive of various processes or stages of secular evolution. Internal perturbations such as bars can drive secular evolution through gravity torques that move gas into the central regions and build up a flattened, disk-like central bulge, or which may convert an open spiral pseudoring into a more closed ring. Interaction between individual components of a galaxy, such as between a bar and a dark halo, a bar and a central mass concentration, or between a perturbation and the basic state of a stellar disk, can also drive secular transformations. In this series of lectures, I review many aspects of galaxy morphology with a view to delineating some of the possible evolutionary pathways between different galaxy types."
2015-01-12,2,"Towards a fully consistent Milky Way disc model - III. Constraining the initial mass function We use our vertical Milky Way disc model together with Galaxia to create mock observations of stellar samples in the solar neighbourhood. We compare these to the corresponding volume complete observational samples of dereddened and binary accounted data from Hipparcos and the Catalogue of Nearby Stars. Sampling the likelihood in the parameter space we determine a new fiducial IMF considering constraints from dwarf and giant stars. The resulting IMF observationally backed in the range from 0.5 to 10 Msun is a two slope broken power law with -1.49 +- 0.08 for the low mass slope, a break at 1.39 +- 0.05 Msun and a high mass slope of -3.02 +- 0.06. The Besancon group also converging to a similar IMF even though their observational sample being quite different to ours shows that the forward modelling technique is a powerful diagnostic to test theoretical concepts like the local field star IMF."
2015-08-18,2,"Offset between stellar spiral arms and gas arms of the Milky Way Spiral arms shown by different components may not be spatially coincident, which can constrain formation mechanisms of spiral structure in a galaxy. We reassess the spiral arm tangency directions in the Milky Way through identifying the bump features in the longitude plots of survey data for infrared stars, radio recombination lines (RRLs), star formation sites, CO, high density regions in clouds, and HI. The bump peaks are taken as indications for arm tangencies, which are close to the real density peaks near the spiral arm tangency point but often have $\sim$ 1$^\circ$ offset to the interior of spiral arms. The arm tangencies identified from the longitudes plots for RRLs, HII regions, methanol masers, CO, high density gas regions, and HI gas appear nearly the same Galactic longitude, and therefore there is no obvious offset for spiral arms traced by different gas components. However, we find obvious displacements of 1.3$^\circ-$ 5.8$^\circ$ between gaseous bump peaks from the directions of the maximum density of old stars near the tangencies of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, the northern part of the Near 3 kpc Arm, and maybe also the Sagittarius Arm. The offsets between the density peaks of gas and old stars for spiral arms are comparable with the arm widths, which is consistent with expectations for quasi-stationary density wave in our Galaxy."
2016-11-04,2,"A Catalog of New Spectroscopically Confirmed Massive OB Stars in Carina The Carina star-forming region is one of the largest in the Galaxy, and its massive star population is still being unveiled. The large number of stars combined with high, and highly variable, interstellar extinction makes it inherently difficult to find OB stars in this type of young region. We present the results of a spectroscopic campaign to study the massive star population of the Carina Nebula, with the primary goal to confirm or reject previously identified Carina OB star candidates. A total of 141 known O- and B-type stars and 94 candidates were observed, of which 73 candidates had a high enough signal-to-noise ratio to classify. We find 23 new OB stars within the Carina Nebula, a 32% confirmation rate. One of the new OB stars has blended spectra and is suspected to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2). We also reclassify the spectral types of the known OB stars and discover nine new SB2s among this population. Finally, we discuss the spatial distribution of these new OB stars relative to known structures in the Carina NSebula."
2016-10-26,2,"Constraining the Thin Disc Initial Mass Function using Galactic Classical Cepheids Context: The Initial Mass Function (IMF) plays a crucial role on galaxy evolution and its implications on star formation theory make it a milestone for the next decade. It is in the intermediate and high mass ranges where the uncertainties of the IMF are larger. This is a major subject of debate and analysis both for Galactic and extragalactic science. Aims: Our goal is to constrain the IMF of the Galactic thin disc population using both Galactic Classical Cepheids and Tycho-2 data. Methods: For the first time the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model (BGM) has been used to characterise the Galactic population of the Classical Cepheids. We have modified the age configuration in the youngest populations of the BGM thin disc model to avoid artificial discontinuities in the age distribution of the simulated Cepheids. Three statistical methods, optimized for different mass ranges, have been developed and applied to search for the best IMF that fits the observations. This strategy allows us to quantify variations in the Star Formation History (SFH), the stellar density at Sun position and the thin disc radial scale length. A rigorous treatment of unresolved multiple stellar systems has been undertaken adopting a spatial resolution according to the catalogues used. Results: For intermediate masses, our study favours a composite field-star IMF slope of $\alpha=3.2$ for the local thin disc, excluding flatter values such as the Salpeter IMF ($\alpha=2.35$). Moreover, a constant Star Formation History is definitively excluded, the three statistical methods considered here show that it is inconsistent with the observational data. Conclusions: Using field stars and Galactic Classical Cepheids, we have found, above $1M_\odot$, an IMF steeper than the canonical stellar IMF of associations and young clusters. This result is consistent with the predictions of the Integrated Galactic IMF."
2016-10-24,2,"The deep OB star population in Carina from the VST Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (VPHAS+) Massive OB stars are critical to the ecology of galaxies, and yet our knowledge of OB stars in the Milky Way, fainter than $V \sim 12$, remains patchy. Data from the VST Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (VPHAS+) permit the construction of the first deep catalogues of blue excess-selected OB stars, without neglecting the stellar field. A total of 14900 candidates with 2MASS cross-matches are blue-selected from a 42 square-degree region in the Galactic Plane, capturing the Carina Arm over the Galactic longitude range $282^{\circ} \lesssim \ell \lesssim 293^{\circ}$. Spectral energy distribution fitting is performed on these candidates' combined VPHAS+ $u,g,r,i$ and 2MASS $J,H,K$ magnitudes. This delivers: effective temperature constraints, statistically separating O from early-B stars; high-quality extinction parameters, $A_0$ and $R_V$ (random errors typically $< 0.1$). The high-confidence O-B2 candidates number 5915 and a further 5170 fit to later B spectral type. Spectroscopy of 276 of the former confirms 97% of them. The fraction of emission line stars among all candidate B stars is 7--8% . Greyer ($R_V > 3.5$) extinction laws are ubiquitous in the region, over the distance range 2.5--3 kpc to $\sim$10~kpc. Near prominent massive clusters, $R_V$ tends to rise, with particularly large and chaotic excursions to $R_V \sim 5$ seen in the Carina Nebula. The data reveal a hitherto unnoticed association of 108 O-B2 stars around the O5If$+$ star LSS 2063 ($\ell = 289.77^{\circ}$, $b = -1.22^{\circ}$). Treating the OB star scale-height as a constant within the thin disk, we find an orderly mean relation between extinction ($A_0$) and distance in the Galactic longitude range, $287.6^{\circ} < \ell < 293.5^{\circ}$, and infer the subtle onset of thin-disk warping. A halo around NGC 3603, roughly a degree in diameter, of $\sim$500 O-B2 stars with $4 < A_0 (\rm{mag}) < 7$ is noted."
2016-10-17,2,"Star Formation Law in the Milky Way The Schmidt law (SF law) in the Milky Way was investigated using 3D distribution maps of HII regions, HI and molecular (\Htwo) gases with spatial resolutions of $\sim 1$ kpc in the Galactic plane and a few tens of pc in the vertical direction. HII regions were shown to be distributed in a star-forming (SF) disk with nearly constant vertical full thickness 92 pc in spatial coincidence with the molecular gas disk. The vertically averaged volume star formation rate (SFR) $\rho_{\rm SFR}$ in the SF disk is related to the surface SFR $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ by $\rho_{\rm SFR} /[{\rm M_\odot y^{-1} kpc^{-3}}] =9.26\times \Sigma_{\rm SFR}/[{\rm M_\odot y^{-1} kpc^{-2}}]$. The SF law fitted by a single power law of gas density in the form of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \rho_{\rm SFR} \propto \rho_{\rm gas}^\alpha$ and $\propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^\beta$ showed indices of $\alpha=0.78 \pm 0.05$ for $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ and $2.15 \pm 0.08$ for $\rho_{\rm total}$, and $\beta=1.14\pm 0.23$ for $\Sigma_{\rm total}$, where $\rho$ and $\Sigma$ denote volume and surface densities, respectively. The star formation rate is shown to be directly related to the molecular gas, but indirectly to HI and total gas densities. The dependence of the SF law on the gaseous phase is explained by the phase transition theory between HI and H$_2$ gases."
2013-08-28,2,"A Galaxy Model from 2MASS Star Counts in the Whole Sky Including the Plane We use the star counts model of Ortiz & L\'epine (1993) to perform an unprecedented exploration of the most important galactic parameters comparing the predicted counts with the 2MASS observed star counts in the J, H and K_S bands for a grid of positions covering the whole sky. The comparison is made using a grid of lines-of-sight given by the HEALPix pixelization scheme. The resulting best fit values for the parameters are: (2120 +- 200) pc for the radial scale length and (205 +- 40) pc for the scale height of the thin disk, with a central hole of (2070_{-800}^{+2000}) pc for the same disk; (3050 +- 500) pc for the radial scale length and (640 +- 70) pc for the scale height of the thick disk; (400 +- 100) pc for the central dimension of the spheroid, (0.0082 +- 0.0030) for the spheroid to disk density ratio, and (0.57 +- 0.05) for the oblate spheroid parameter."
2016-10-15,2,"The Assembly History of Globular Cluster Star Streams The early accretion onto the Milky Way of satellite galaxies containing dense star clusters is a likely source of the halo globular clusters and the beginning of their associated stellar streams. The process of infall of a satellite with dynamical friction and subsequent merging is simulated with a simple evolving potential model. King model clusters are initiated within the satellite galaxy on circular orbits in a disk. Merging places the clusters on new orbits that substantially underfill their tidal radii, requiring that some internal relaxation of the clusters must be included to cause them to expand to their new tidal surface and start or continue to produce star streams. A toy model with a simplified Monte Carlo relaxation procedure gives the clusters star particles random velocity kicks at approximately the rate expected from collisional dynamics. The clusters expand and lose stars to evaporation leading to tidal streams that have local properties, including sub-halo gaps, as expected in a static halo. The main difference is that the streams are, on the average, denser and lower velocity dispersion near to the clusters than they are further away, making the older parts of the streams relatively less visible. Comparing the numbers of dense stellar systems that likely formed and orbit within the range of galactic radii where streams are visible to the Pan-STARRS1 survey finds that the number of detected streams is comparable to the number of ""lost"" globular clusters above $10^5$ M_sun, assuming that the detected streams follow the expectation that they arose from the most massive evaporated and evaporating clusters."
2016-10-04,2,"Chemical distribution of HII regions towards the Galactic anticentre We study the physical and chemical properties of a sample of HII regions located at RG >11 kpc and present the radial distribution of abundances towards the Galaxy anticentre. We carried out optical spectroscopic observations of nine HII regions with the WHT. The sample was increased by searching the literature for optical observations of regions towards the Galactic anticentre, re-analysing them to obtain a single sample of 23 objects covering the Galactocentric radius from 11 kpc to 18 kpc to be processed in a homogeneous and consistent manner. Accurate electron densities and temperatures of several ionic species were derived in 13 HII regions. These physical parameters were applied to the spectra to determine direct total chemical abundances. For those regions without direct estimations of temperature, chemical abundances were derived by performing tailor-made photoionisation models and/or by using an empirical relation obtained from radio recombination and optical temperatures. We performed weighted least-squares fits to the distribution of the derived abundances along the Galactocentric distances to study the radial gradients of metallicity. The distributions O/H, N/H, S/H, and Ar/H towards the anticentre can be represented by decreasing linear radial gradients, while in the case of N/O abundances the radial distribution is better fitted with a two-zone model. The He/H radial gradient is presented here for the first time; we find a slope that is not significantly different from zero. The derived gradient for oxygen shows a clear decrease with distance with a slope of -0.053dex/kpc. Although a shallower slope at large Galactocentric distances is suggested by our data, the flattening of the distribution cannot be confirmed and more objects towards the anticentre need to be studied in order to establish the true form of the metallicity gradient."
2016-10-01,2,"The local spiral structure of the Milky Way The nature of the spiral structure of the Milky Way has long been debated. Only in the last decade have astronomers been able to accurately measure distances to a substantial number of high-mass star-forming regions, the classic tracers of spiral structure in galaxies. We report distance measurements at radio wavelengths using the Very Long Baseline Array for eight regions of massive star formation near the Local spiral arm of the Milky Way. Combined with previous measurements, these observations reveal that the Local Arm is larger than previously thought, and both its pitch angle and star formation rate are comparable to those of the Galaxy's major spiral arms, such as Sagittarius and Perseus. Toward the constellation Cygnus, sources in the Local Arm extend for a great distance along our line of sight and roughly along the solar orbit. Because of this orientation, these sources cluster both on the sky and in velocity to form the complex and long enigmatic Cygnus X region. We also identify a spur that branches between the Local and Sagittarius spiral arms."
2015-09-21,2,"Evidence That Hydra I is a Tidally Disrupting Milky Way Dwarf Galaxy The Eastern Banded Structure (EBS) and Hydra~I halo overdensity are very nearby (d $\sim$ 10 kpc) objects discovered in SDSS data. Previous studies of the region have shown that EBS and Hydra I are spatially coincident, cold structures at the same distance, suggesting that Hydra I may be the EBS's progenitor. We combine new wide-field DECam imaging and MMT/Hectochelle spectroscopic observations of Hydra I with SDSS archival spectroscopic observations to quantify Hydra I's present-day chemodynamical properties, and to infer whether it originated as a star cluster or dwarf galaxy. While previous work using shallow SDSS imaging assumed a standard old, metal-poor stellar population, our deeper DECam imaging reveals that Hydra~I has a thin, well-defined main sequence turnoff of intermediate age ($\sim 5-6$ Gyr) and metallicity ([Fe/H] = $-0.9$ dex). We measure statistically significant spreads in both the iron and alpha-element abundances of $\sigma_{[Fe/H]} = 0.13 \pm 0.02$ dex and $\sigma_{[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]} = 0.09 \pm 0.03$ dex, respectively, and place upper limits on both the rotation and its proper motion. Hydra~I's intermediate age and [Fe/H] -- as well as its low [$\alpha$/Fe], apparent [Fe/H] spread, and present-day low luminosity -- suggest that its progenitor was a dwarf galaxy, which subsequently lost more than $99.99\%$ of its stellar mass."
2016-09-01,2,"Inferring the three-dimensional distribution of dust in the Galaxy with a non-parametric method: Preparing for Gaia We present a non-parametric model for inferring the three-dimensional  (3D) distribution of dust density in the Milky Way. Our approach uses the extinction measured towards stars at different locations in the Galaxy at approximately known distances. Each extinction measurement is proportional to the integrated dust density along its line-of-sight. Making simple assumptions about the spatial correlation of the dust density, we can infer the most probable 3D distribution of dust across the entire observed region, including along sight lines which were not observed. This is possible because our model employs a Gaussian Process to connect all lines-of-sight. We demonstrate the capability of our model to capture detailed dust density variations using mock data as well as simulated data from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot. We then apply our method to a sample of giant stars observed by APOGEE and Kepler to construct a 3D dust map over a small region of the Galaxy. Due to our smoothness constraint and its isotropy, we provide one of the first maps which does not show the ""fingers of god"" effect."
2016-09-05,2,"A radial age gradient in the geometrically thick disk of the Milky Way In the Milky Way, the thick disk can be defined using individual stellar abundances, kinematics, or age; or geometrically, as stars high above the mid-plane. In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric definition can be used, thick disks appear to have large radial scale-lengths, and their red colors suggest that they are uniformly old. The Milky Way's geometrically thick disk is also radially extended, but it is far from chemically uniform: alpha-enhanced stars are confined within the inner Galaxy. In simulated galaxies, where old stars are centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks are radially extended, too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated disks' outer regions, bringing those stars high above the mid-plane. The resulting geometrically thick disks therefore show a radial age gradient, from old in their central regions to younger in their outskirts. Based on our age estimates for a large sample of giant stars in the APOGEE survey, we can now test this scenario for the Milky Way. We find that the geometrically-defined thick disk in the Milky Way has indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median age for red clump stars goes from ~9 Gyr in the inner disk to 5 Gyr in the outer disk. We propose that at least some nearby galaxies could also have thick disks that are not uniformly old, and that geometrically thick disks might be complex structures resulting from different formation mechanisms in their inner and outer parts."
2016-09-05,2,"The age structure of the Milky Way's halo We present a new, high-resolution chronographic (age) map of the Milky Way's halo, based on the inferred ages of ~130,000 field blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars with photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our map exhibits a strong central concentration of BHB stars with ages greater than 12 Gyr, extending up to ~15 kpc from the Galactic center (reaching close to the solar vicinity), and a decrease in the mean ages of field stars with distance by 1-1.5 Gyr out to ~45-50 kpc, along with an apparent increase of the dispersion of stellar ages, and numerous known (and previously unknown) resolved over-densities and debris streams, including the Sagittarius Stream. These results agree with expectations from modern LambdaCDM cosmological simulations, and support the existence of a dual (inner/outer) halo system, punctuated by the presence of over-densities and debris streams that have not yet completely phase-space mixed."
2002-02-01,2,"Abundance Gradient from Open Clusters and Implications for the Galactic Disk Evolution We compile a new sample of 89 open clusters with ages, distances and metallicities available. We derive a radial iron gradient of about -0.099±0.008 dexkpc (unweighted) for the whole sample, which is somewhat greater than the most recent determination of oxygen gradient from nebulae and young stars. By dividing the clusters into age groups, we show that the iron gradient was steeper in the past and has evolved slowly in time. Current data show a substantial scatter of the cluster metallicities indicating that the Galactic disk has undergone a very rapid, inhomogeneous enrichment.Also, based on a simple, but quite successful model of chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk, we make a detailed calculation of the iron abundance gradient and its time evolution. The predicted current iron gradient is about -0.072 dexkpc. The model also predicts a steady flattening of the iron gradient with time, which agrees with the result from our open cluster sample."
1999-08-01,2,"New constraints on a triaxial model of the Galaxy We determine the most likely values of the free parameters of an N-body model for the Galaxy developed by Fux via a discrete-discrete comparison with the positions on the sky and line-of-sight velocities of an unbiased, homogeneous sample of OH/IR stars. Via Monte Carlo simulation, we find the plausibility of the best-fitting models, as well as the errors on the determined values. The parameters that are constrained best by these projected data are the total mass of the model and the viewing angle of the central bar, although the distribution of the latter has multiple maxima. The other two free parameters, the size of the bar and the (azimuthal) velocity of the Sun, are less well-constrained. The best model has a viewing angle of ~ 44 deg, a semimajor axis of 2.5kpc (corotation radius 4.5kpc, pattern speed 46kms^-1kpc^-1), a bar mass of 1.7x10^10M_solar and a tangential velocity of the local standard of rest of 171kms^-1. We argue that the lower values that are commonly found from stellar data for the viewing angle (~25 deg) arise when too few coordinates are available, when the longitude range is too narrow or when low latitudes are excluded from the fit. The new constraints on the viewing angle of the Galactic bar from stellar line-of-sight velocities decrease further the ability of the distribution of the bar to account for the observed microlensing optical depth toward Baade's window: our model reproduces only half the observed value. The signal of triaxiality diminishes quickly with increasing latitude, fading within approximately 1 scaleheight (<~3 deg). This suggests that Baade's window is not a very appropriate region in which to sample bar properties."
2016-10-05,2,"KMOS view of the Galactic Centre - II. Metallicity distribution of late-type stars Knowing the metallicity distribution of stars in the Galactic Centre has important implications for the formation history of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. However, this distribution is not well known, and is currently based on a small sample of fewer than 100 stars. We obtained near-infrared K-band spectra of more than 700 late-type stars in the central 4 pc^2 of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster with the integral-field spectrograph KMOS (VLT). We analyse the medium-resolution spectra using a full-spectral fitting method employing the G\""ottingen Spectral library of synthetic PHOENIX spectra. The derived stellar metallicities range from metal-rich [M/H]>+0.3 dex to metal-poor [M/H]<-1.0 dex, with a fraction of 5.2(^{+6.0}+{-3.1}) per cent metal-poor ([M/H]<-0.5 dex) stars. The metal-poor stars are distributed over the entire observed field. The origin of metal-poor stars remains unclear. They could originate from infalling globular clusters. For the metal-rich stellar population ([M/H]>0 dex) a globular cluster origin can be ruled out. As there is only a very low fraction of metal-poor stars in the central 4 pc^2 of the Galactic Centre, we believe that our data can discard a scenario in which the Milky Way nuclear star cluster is purely formed from infalling globular clusters."
2016-11-25,2,"Variability in the Milky Way: Contact binaries as diagnostic tools We used the 50 cm Binocular Network (50BiN) telescope at Delingha Station (Qinghai Province) of Purple Mountain Observatory (Chinese Academy of Sciences) to obtain simultaneous $V$- and $R$-band observations of the old open cluster NGC 188. Our aim was a search for populations of variable stars. We derived light-curve solutions for six W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) eclipsing-binary systems and estimated their orbital parameters. The resulting distance to the W UMas is independent of the physical characteristics of the host cluster. We next determined the current best period--luminosity relations for contact binaries (CBs; scatter $\sigma < 0.10$ mag). We conclude that CBs can be used as distance tracers with better than 5\% uncertainty. We apply our new relations to the 102 CBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which yields a distance modulus of $(m-M_V)_0=18.41\pm0.20$ mag."
2016-01-11,2,"On the Origin of High-Altitude Open Clusters in the Milky Way We present a dynamical study of the effect of the bar and spiral arms on the simulated orbits of open clusters in the Galaxy. Specifically, this work is devoted to the puzzling presence of high-altitude open clusters in the Galaxy. For this purpose we employ a very detailed observationally motivated potential model for the Milky Way and a careful set of initial conditions representing the newly born open clusters in the thin disk. We find that the spiral arms are able to raise an important percentage of open clusters (about one-sixth of the total employed in our simulations, depending on the structural parameters of the arms) above the Galactic plane to heights beyond 200 pc, producing a bulge-shaped structure toward the center of the Galaxy. Contrary to what was expected, the spiral arms produce a much greater vertical effect on the clusters than the bar, both in quantity and height; this is due to the sharper concentration of the mass on the spiral arms, when compared to the bar. When a bar and spiral arms are included, spiral arms are still capable of raising an important percentage of the simulated open clusters through chaotic diffusion (as tested from classification analysis of the resultant high-z orbits), but the bar seems to restrain them, diminishing the elevation above the plane by a factor of about two."
2016-11-19,2,"The contribution of dissolving star clusters to the population of ultra-faint objects in the outer halo of the Milky Way In the last decade, several ultra faint objects (UFOs, $M_V\gtrsim-3.5$) have been discovered in the outer halo of the Milky Way. For some of these objects it is not clear whether they are star clusters or (ultra-faint) dwarf galaxies. In this work we quantify the contribution of star clusters to the population of UFOs. We extrapolated the mass and Galactocentric radius distribution of the globular clusters using a population model, finding that the Milky Way contains about $3.3^{+7.3}_{-1.6}$ star clusters with $M_V\gtrsim-3.5$ and Galactocentric radius $\geq20\,$kpc. To understand whether dissolving clusters can appear as UFOs, we run a suite of direct $N$-body models, varying the orbit, the Galactic potential, the binary fraction and the black hole (BH) natal kick velocities. In the analyses, we consider observational biases such as: luminosity limit, field stars, and line-of-sight projection. We find that star clusters contribute to both the compact and the extended population of UFOs: clusters without BHs appear compact with radii $\sim5\,$pc, while clusters that retain their BHs after formation have radii $\gtrsim20\,$pc. The properties of the extended clusters are remarkably similar to those of dwarf galaxies: high inferred mass-to-light ratios due to binaries; binary properties mildly affected by dynamical evolution; no observable mass segregation; and flattened stellar mass function. We conclude that the slope of the stellar mass function as a function of Galactocentric radius and the presence/absence of cold streams can discriminate between DM free and DM dominated UFOs."
2016-06-21,2,"Study of open clusters within 1.8 kpc and understanding the Galactic structure Based on an almost complete sample of Galactic open star clusters within 1.8 kpc, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of various cluster parameters like spatial position, age, size, mass and extinction in order to understand the general properties of the open cluster system in the Galaxy and the Galactic structure. Based on the distribution of 1241 open clusters about the Galactic plane and in different age bins, we find the average Galactic scale height as Zh = 60+/-2 pc for the youngest cluster population having Age <700 Myr, however, it increases up to 64+/-2 pc when we also include older population of clusters. The solar offset is found to be 6.2+/-1.1 pc above the formal Galactic plane. We derive a local mass density of \rho_0 = 0.090+/-0.005 Msun/pc^3 and found a negligibly small amount of dark matter in the solar neighbourhood. The reddening in the direction of clusters suggests a strong correlation with their vertical distance from the Galactic plane having a respective slope of dE(B-V)/dz = 0.40+/-0.04 and 0.42+/-0.05 mag/kpc below and above the GP. We observe a linear mass-radius and mass-age relations in the open clusters and derive a slope of dR/d(logM) = 2.08+/-0.10 and d(logM)/d(logT) = -0.36+/-0.05,respectively."
2016-02-05,2,"The start of the Sagittarius spiral arm (Sagittarius origin) and the start of the Norma spiral arm (Norma origin) - model-computed and observed arm tangents at galactic longitudes -20 degrees < l < +23 degrees Here we fitted a 4-arm spiral structure to the more accurate data on global arm pitch angle and arm longitude tangents, to get the start of each spiral arm near the Galactic nucleus. We find that the tangent to the 'start of the Sagittarius' spiral arm (arm middle) is at l= -17 degrees +/- 0.5 degree, while the tangent to the 'start of the Norma' spiral arm (arm middle) is at l= +20 degrees +/- 0.5 degree. Earlier, we published a compilation of observations and analysis of the tangent to each spiral arm tracer, from longitudes +23 degrees to +340 degrees; here we cover the arm tracers in the remaining longitudes +340 degrees (=- 20 degrees) to +23 degrees. Our model arm tangents are confirmed through the recent observed masers data (at the arm's inner edge). Observed arm tracers in the inner Galaxy show an offset from the mid-arm; this was also found elsewhere in the Milky Way disk (Vallee 2014c). In addition, we collated the observed tangents to the so-called '3-kpc-arm' features; here they are found statistically to be near l= -18 degrees +/- 2 degrees and near l= +21 degrees +/- 2 degrees, after excluding misidentified spiral arms. We find that the model-computed arm tangents in the inner Galaxcy are spatially coincident with the mean longitude of the observed tangents to the '3-kpc-arm' features (same galactic longitudes, within the errors). These spatial similarities may be suggestive of a contiguous space."
2015-10-14,2,"Accretion, radial flows and abundance gradients in spiral galaxies The metal-poor gas continuously accreting onto the discs of spiral galaxies is unlikely to arrive from the intergalactic medium (IGM) with exactly the same rotation velocity as the galaxy itself and even a small angular momentum mismatch inevitably drives radial gas flows within the disc, with significant consequences to galaxy evolution. Here we provide some general analytic tools to compute accretion profiles, radial gas flows and abundance gradients in spiral galaxies as a function of the angular momentum of accreting material. We generalize existing solutions for the decomposition of the gas flows, required to reproduce the structural properties of galaxy discs, into direct accretion from the IGM and a radial mass flux within the disc. We then solve the equation of metallicity evolution in the presence of radial gas flows with a novel method, based on characteristic lines, which greatly reduces the numerical demand on the computation and sheds light on the crucial role of boundary conditions on the abundance profiles predicted by theoretical models. We also discuss how structural and chemical constraints can be combined to disentangle the contributions of inside-out growth and radial flows in the development of abundance gradients in spiral galaxies. Illustrative examples are provided throughout with parameters plausible for the Milky Way."
2012-01,2,"Variations of the Interstellar Extinction Law within the Nearest Kiloparsec Multicolor photometry from the Tycho-2 and 2MASS catalogues for 11 990 OB and 30 671 K-type red giant branch stars is used to detect systematic large-scale variations of the interstellar extinction law within the nearest kiloparsec. The characteristic of the extinction law, the total-to-selective extinction ratio $R_V$, which also characterizes the size and other properties of interstellar dust grains, has been calculated for various regions of space by the extinction law extrapolation method. The results for the two classes of stars agree: the standard deviation of the ""red giants minus OB"" $R_V$ differences within 500 pc of the Sun is 0.2. The detected $R_V$ variations between 2.2 and 4.4 not only manifest themselves in individual clouds but also span the entire space near the Sun, following Galactic structures. In the Local Bubble within about 100 pc of the Sun, $R_V$ has a minimum. In the inner part of the Gould Belt and at high Galactic latitudes, at a distance of about 150 pc from the Sun, $R_V$ reaches a maximum and then decreases to its minimum in the outer part of the Belt and other directions at a distance of about 500 pc from the Sun, returning to its mean values far from the Sun. The detected maximum of $R_V$ at high Galactic latitudes is important when allowance is made for the interstellar extinction toward extragalactic objects. In addition, a monotonic increase in $R_V$ by 0.3 per kpc toward the Galactic center has been found near the Galactic equator. It is consistent with the result obtained by Zasowski et al. (2009) for much of the Galaxy. Ignoring the $R_V$ variations and traditionally using a single value for the entire space must lead to systematic errors in the calculated distances reaching 10\%."
2015-11-10,2,"The complex stellar populations in the lines of sight to open clusters in the third Galactic quadrant Multi-color photometry of the stellar populations in five fields in the third Galactic quadrant centred on the clusters NGC 2215, NGC 2354, Haffner 22, Ruprecht 11, and ESO489SC01 is interpreted in terms of a warped and flared Galactic disk, without resort to an external entity such as the popular Monoceros or Canis Major overdensities. Except for NGC 2215, the clusters are poorly or unstudied previously. The data generate basic parameters for each cluster, including the distribution of stars along the line of sight. We use star counts and photometric analysis, without recourse to Galactic-model-based predictions or interpretations, and confirms earlier results for NGC 2215 and NGC 2354. ESO489SC01 is not a real cluster, while Haffner~22 is an overlooked cluster aged about 2.5 Gyr. Conclusions for Ruprecht~11 are preliminary, evidence for a cluster being marginal. Fields surrounding the clusters show signatures of young and intermediate-age stellar populations. The young population background to NGC~2354 and Ruprecht~11 lies 8-9 kpc from the Sun and $\sim$1 kpc below the formal Galactic plane, tracing a portion of the Norma-Cygnus arm, challenging Galactic models that adopt a sharp cut-off of the disk 12-14 kpc from the Galactic center. The old population is metal poor with an age of 2-3 Gyr, resembling star clusters like Tombaugh 2 or NGC 2158. It has a large color spread and is difficult to locate precisely. Young and old populations follow a pattern that depends critically on the vertical location of the thin and/or thick disk, and whether or not a particular line of sight intersects one, both, or none."
2015-04-06,2,"The Structure of the Milky Way's Bar Outside the Bulge While it is incontrovertible that the inner Galaxy contains a bar, its structure near the Galactic plane has remained uncertain, where extinction from intervening dust is greatest. We investigate here the Galactic bar outside the bulge, the long bar, using red clump giant (RCG) stars from UKIDSS, 2MASS, VVV, and GLIMPSE. We match and combine these surveys to investigate a wide area in latitude and longitude, |b|<9deg and |l|<40deg. We find: (1) The bar extends to l~25deg at |b|~5deg from the Galactic plane, and to l~30deg at lower latitudes. (2) The long bar has an angle to the line-of-sight in the range (28-33)deg, consistent with studies of the bulge at |l|<10deg. (3) The scale-height of RCG stars smoothly transitions from the bulge to the thinner long bar. (4) There is evidence for two scale heights in the long bar. We find a ~180pc thin bar component reminiscent of the old thin disk near the sun, and a ~45pc super-thin bar component which exists predominantly towards the bar end. (5) Constructing parametric models for the RC magnitude distributions, we find a bar half length of 5.0+-0.2kpc for the 2-component bar, and 4.6+-0.3kpc for the thin bar component alone. We conclude that the Milky Way contains a central box/peanut bulge which is the vertical extension of a longer, flatter bar, similar as seen in both external galaxies and N-body models."
2015-03-18,2,"The morphology of the Milky Way - II. Reconstructing CO maps from disc galaxies with live stellar distributions The arm structure of the Milky Way remains somewhat of an unknown, with observational studies hindered by our location within the Galactic disc. In the work presented here we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and radiative transfer to create synthetic longitude-velocity observations. Our aim is to reverse-engineer a top down map of the Galaxy by comparing synthetic longitude-velocity maps to those observed. We set up a system of N-body particles to represent the disc and bulge, allowing for dynamic creation of spiral features. Interstellar gas, and the molecular content, is evolved alongside the stellar system. A 3D-radiative transfer code is then used to compare the models to observational data. The resulting models display arm features that are a good reproduction of many of the observed emission structures of the Milky Way. These arms however are dynamic and transient, allowing for a wide range of morphologies not possible with standard density wave theory. The best fitting models are a much better match than previous work using fixed potentials. They favour a 4-armed model with a pitch angle of approximately 20 degrees, though with a pattern speed that decreases with increasing Galactic radius. Inner bars are lacking however, which appear required to fully reproduce the central molecular zone."
2016-06-29,2,"Extinction Law at a Distance up to 25 kpc toward the Galactic Poles Photometry from the Tycho-2, 2MASS, and WISE catalogues for clump and branch giants at a distance up to 25 kpc toward the Galactic poles has allowed the variations of various characteristics of the infrared interstellar extinction law with distance to be analyzed. The results obtained by the extinction law extrapolation method are consistent for different classes of stars and different characteristics as well as with previous studies. The conventional extinction law with a low infrared extinction is characteristic of only a thin layer no farther than 100 pc from the Galactic plane and of two thin layers near $Z=-600$ and $+500$ pc. Far from the Galactic plane, in the Galactic halo, the infrared extinction law is different: the extinction in the $Ks$, $W1$, $W2$, $W3$, and $W4$ bands is, respectively, $0.17$, $0.16$, $0.16$, $0.07$, and $0.03$ of the extinction in the $V$ band. The accuracy of these coefficients is $0.03$. If the extinction law reflects primarily the grain size distribution, then the fraction of large dust grains far from the Galactic plane is greater than that in the circumsolar interstellar medium."
2016-08-04,2,"Milky Way's Thick and Thin disk: Is there distinct thick disk? This article is based on our discussion session on Milky Way models at the 592 WE-Heraeus Seminar, Reconstructing the Milky Way's History: Spectroscopic Surveys, Asteroseismology and Chemodynamical models. The discussion focused on the following question: ""Are there distinct thick and thin disks?"". The answer to this question depends on the definition one adopts for thin and thick disks. The participants of this discussion converged to the idea that there are at least two different types of disks in the Milky Way. However, there are still important open questions on how to best define these two types of disks (chemically, kinematically, geometrically or by age?). The question of what is the origin of the distinct disks remains open. The future Galactic surveys which are highlighted in this conference should help us answering these questions. The almost one-hour debate involving researchers in the field representing different modelling approaches (Galactic models such as TRILEGAL, Besancon and Galaxia, chemical evolution models, extended distribution functions method, chemodynamics in the cosmological context, and self-consistent cosmological simulations) illustrated how important is to have all these parallel approaches. All approaches have their advantages and shortcomings (also discussed), and different approaches are useful to address specific points that might help us answering the more general question above."
2015-04-08,2,"Clues to the formation of the Milky Way's thick disk We analyse the chemical properties of a set of solar vicinity stars, and show that the small dispersion in abundances of \alpha-elements at all ages provides evidence that the SFH has been uniform throughout the thick disk. In the context of long time scale infall models, we suggest that this result points either to a limited dependence of the gas accretion on the Galactic radius in the inner disk (R<10 kpc), or to a decoupling of the accretion history and star formation history due to other processes governing the ISM in the early disk, suggesting that infall cannot be a determining parameter of the chemical evolution at these epochs. We argue however that these results and other recent observational constraints -- namely the lack of radial metallicity gradient and the non-evolving scale length of the thick disk -- are better explained if the early disk is viewed as a pre-assembled gaseous system, with most of the gas settled before significant star formation took place -- formally the equivalent of a closed-box model. In any case, these results point to a weak, or non-existent inside-out formation history in the thick disk, or in the first 3-5 Gyr of the formation of the Galaxy. We argue however that the growing importance of an external disk whose chemical properties are distinct from those of the inner disk would give the impression of an inside-out growth process when seen through snapshots at different epochs. However, the progressive, continuous process usually invoked may not have actually existed in the Milky Way."
2015-08-11,2,"Star Formation in the Local Milky Way Studies of molecular clouds and young stars near the sun have provided invaluable insights into the process of star formation. Indeed, much of our physical understanding of this topic has been derived from such studies. Perhaps the two most fundamental problems confronting star formation research today are: 1) determining the origin of stellar mass and 2) deciphering the nature of the physical processes that control the star formation rate in molecular gas. As I will briefly outline here, observations and studies of local star forming regions are making particularly significant contributions toward the solution of both these important problems."

2017-01-01,2,"Outer Regions of the Milky Way With the start of the Gaia era, the time has come to address the major challenge of deriving the star formation history and evolution of the disk of our MilkyWay. Here we review our present knowledge of the outer regions of the Milky Way disk population. Its stellar content, its structure and its dynamical and chemical evolution are summarized, focussing on our lack of understanding both from an observational and a theoretical viewpoint. We describe the unprecedented data that Gaia and the upcoming ground-based spectroscopic surveys will provide in the next decade. More in detail, we quantify the expect accuracy in position, velocity and astrophysical parameters of some of the key tracers of the stellar populations in the outer Galactic disk. Some insights on the future capability of these surveys to answer crucial and fundamental issues are discussed, such as the mechanisms driving the spiral arms and the warp formation. Our Galaxy, theMilkyWay, is our cosmological laboratory for understanding the process of formation and evolution of disk galaxies.

The dependence with the age of stellar population parameters would be linked with the history of star formation and dynamical evolution. Aims: We investigate the structures of the outer Galaxy, such as the scale length, disc truncation, warp and flare of the thin disc and study their dependence with age by using 2MASS data and a population synthesis model (the so-called Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model). Methods: A Genetic Algorithm is used to adjust the parameters on the observed colour-magnitude diagrams at longitudes 80\deg <= l <= 280\deg for |b| <= 5.5\deg. We explore parameter degeneracies and uncertainties. Results: We identify a clear dependence of the thin disc scale length, warp and flare shapes with age. The scale length is found to vary between 3.8 kpc for the youngest to about 2 kpc for the oldest. The warp shows a complex structure, clearly asymmetrical with a node angle changing with age from approximately 165\deg for old stars to 195\deg for young stars. The outer disc is also flaring with a scale height varying by a factor of two between the solar neighbourhood and a Galactocentric distance of 12 kpc. Conclusions: We conclude that the thin disc scale length is well in agreement with the inside-out formation scenario and that the outer disc is not in dynamical equilibrium. The warp deformation with time may provide some clues to its origin."
2016-12-20,2,"Theoretical Challenges in Galaxy Formation Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays."
2016-11-17,2,"On the origin of the Schechter-like mass function of young star clusters in disk galaxies The mass function of freshly formed star clusters is empirically often described as a power law. However the cluster mass function of populations of young clusters over the scale of a galaxy has been found to be described by a Schechter-function. Here we address this apparent discrepancy. We assume that in an annulus of an isolated self- regulated radially-exponential axially-symmetric disk galaxy, the local mass function of very young (embedded) clusters is a power law with an upper mass limit which depends on the local star formation rate density. Radial integration of this mass function yields a galaxy-wide embedded cluster mass function. This integrated embedded cluster mass function has a Schechter-type form, which results from the addition of many low mass clusters forming at all galactocentric distances and rarer massive clusters only forming close to the center of the galaxy."
2015-02-10,2,"The Milky Way disk This review summarises the invited presentation I gave on the Milky Way disc. The idea underneath was to touch those topics that can be considered hot nowadays in the Galactic disk research: the reality of the thick disk, the spiral structure of the Milky Way, and the properties of the outer Galactic disk. A lot of work has been done in recent years on these topics, but a coherent and clear picture is still missing. Detailed studies with high quality spectroscopic data seem to support a dual Galactic disk, with a clear separation into a thin and a thick component. Much confusion and very discrepant ideas still exist concerning the spiral structure of the Milky Way. Our location in the disk makes it impossible to observe it, and we can only infer it. This process of inference is still far from being mature, and depends a lot on the selected tracers, the adopted models and their limitations, which in many cases are neither properly accounted for, nor pondered enough. Finally, there are very different opinions on the size (scale length, truncation radius) of the Galactic disk, and on the interpretation of the observed outer disk stellar populations in terms either of external entities (Monoceros, Triangulus-Andromeda, Canis Major), or as manifestations of genuine disk properties (e.g., warp and flare)."
2017-01-01,2,"Modelling the Milky Way's globular cluster system We construct a model for the Galactic globular cluster system based on a realistic gravitational potential and a distribution function (DF) analytic in the action integrals. The DF comprises disc and halo components whose functional forms resemble those recently used to describe the stellar discs and stellar halo. We determine the posterior distribution of our model parameters using a Bayesian approach. This gives us an understanding of how well the globular cluster data constrain our model. The favoured parameter values of the disc and halo DFs are similar to values previously obtained from fits to the stellar disc and halo, although the cluster halo system shows clearer rotation than does the stellar halo. Our model reproduces the generic features of the globular cluster system, namely the density profile, the mean rotation velocity. The fraction of disc clusters coincides with the observed fraction of metal-rich clusters. However, the data indicate either incompatibility between catalogued cluster distances and current estimates of distance to the Galactic Centre, or failure to identify clusters behind the bulge. As the data for our Galaxy's components increase in volume and precision over the next few years, it will be rewarding to revisit the present analysis."
2016-12-14,2,"Modelling mass distribution of the Milky Way galaxy using Gaia billion-star map The Milky Way galaxy is a typical spiral galaxy which consists of a black hole in its centre, a barred bulge and a disk which contains spiral arms. The complex structure of the Galaxy makes it extremely difficult and challenging to model its mass distribution, particularly for the Galactic disk which plays the most important role in the dynamics and evolution of the Galaxy. Conventionally an axisymmetric disk model with an exponential brightness distribution and a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed for the Galactic disk. In order to generate a flat rotation curve, a dark halo has also to be included. Here, by using the recently released Gaia billion-star map, we propose a Galactic disk mass distribution model which is based on the star density distribution rather than the brightness and mass-to-light ratio. The model is characterized by two parameters, a bulge radius and a characteristic length. Using the mass distribution model and solving the Poisson equation of the Galaxy, we obtain a flat rotation curve which reproduces the key observed features with no need for a dark halo."

These catalogs contain $\sim1$ million sources including $\sim859,000$ in M 31 and $\sim116,000$ in the other galaxies. They were created following the procedures described in Khan et al.

2015-03-03,2,"A new method for estimating the pattern speed of spiral structure in the Milky Way In the last few decades many efforts have been made to understand the effect of spiral arms on the gas and stellar dynamics in the Milky Way disc. One of the fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity, or pattern speed $\Omega_p$, which determines the location of resonances in the disc and the spirals' radial extent. The most direct method for estimating the pattern speed relies on backward integration techniques, trying to locate the stellar birthplace of open clusters. Here we propose a new method based on the interaction between the spiral arms and the stars in the disc. Using a sample of around 500 open clusters from the {\it New Catalogue of Optically Visible Open Clusters and Candidates}, and a sample of 500 giant stars observed by APOGEE, we find $\Omega_p = 23.0\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, for a local standard of rest rotation $V_0=220$~km s$^{-1}$ and solar radius $R_0=8.0$~kpc. Exploring a range in $V_0$ and $R_0$ within the acceptable values, 200-240 km s$^{-1}$ and 7.5-8.5 kpc, respectively, results only in a small change in our estimate of $\Omega_p$, that is within the error. Our result is in close agreement with a number of studies which suggest values in the range 20-25 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. An advantage of our method is that we do not need knowledge of the stellar age, unlike in the case of the birthplace method, which allows us to use data from large Galactic surveys. The precision of our method will be improved once larger samples of disk stars with spectroscopic information will become available thanks to future surveys such as 4MOST."
2017-02-01,2,"The kinematic signature of the Galactic warp in Gaia DR1 - I. The Hipparcos subsample The mechanism responsible for the warp of our Galaxy, as well as its  dynamical nature, continues to remain unknown. With the advent of high precision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the kinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation scenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish whether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the kinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics of distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach for analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos stars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars from the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1, covering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the spatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the probability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the systematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is used to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions from both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby OB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more distant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not. The kinematics of our sample of young OB stars suggests that systematic vertical motions in the disk cannot be explained by a simple model of a stable long-lived warp. The Galactic warp may either be a transient feature, or additional phenomena are acting on the gaseous component of the Milky Way, causing systematic vertical motions that are masking the expected warp signal. A larger and deeper sample of stars with Gaia astrometry will be needed to constrain the dynamical nature of the Galactic warp."

2017-03-01,2,"The Gaia-ESO Survey: radial distribution of abundances in the Galactic disc from open clusters and young field stars The spatial distribution of elemental abundances in the disc of our  Galaxy gives insights both on its assembly process and subsequent evolution, and on the stellar nucleogenesis of the different elements. Gradients can be traced using several types of objects as, for instance, (young and old) stars, open clusters, HII regions, planetary nebulae. We aim at tracing the radial distributions of abundances of elements produced through different nucleosynthetic channels -the alpha-elements O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti, and the iron-peak elements Fe, Cr, Ni and Sc - by using the Gaia-ESO idr4 results of open clusters and young field stars. From the UVES spectra of member stars, we determine the average composition of clusters with ages >0.1 Gyr. We derive statistical ages and distances of field stars. We trace the abundance gradients using the cluster and field populations and we compare them with a chemo-dynamical Galactic evolutionary model. Results. The adopted chemo-dynamical model, with the new generation of metallicity-dependent stellar yields for massive stars, is able to reproduce the observed spatial distributions of abundance ratios, in particular the abundance ratios of [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] in the inner disc (5 kpc"
2017-02-01,2,"The Gaia-ESO Survey: the present-day radial metallicity distribution of the Galactic disc probed by pre-main-sequence clusters The radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc represents  a crucial constraint for modelling disc formation and evolution. Open clusters allow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and its evolution over time. In this paper we perform the first investigation of the present-day radial metallicity distribution based on [Fe/H] determinations in late type members of pre-main-sequence clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters are therefore essential for tracing the current inter-stellar medium metallicity. We used the products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young regions (age<100 Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc. For the first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions farther than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through samples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership analysis is discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters (Chamaeleon I and Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in our previous works. All the pre-main-sequence clusters considered in this paper have close-to-solar or slightly sub-solar metallicities. The radial metallicity distribution traced by these clusters is almost flat, with the innermost star forming regions having [Fe/H] values that are 0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older clusters located at similar Galactocentric radii. This homogeneous study of the present-day radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc favours models that predict a flattening of the radial gradient over time. On the other hand, the decrease of the average [Fe/H] at young ages is not easily explained by the models. Our results reveal a complex interplay of several processes (e.g. star formation activity, initial mass function, supernova yields, gas flows) that controlled the recent evolution of the Milky Way."
2017-02-01,2,"Population synthesis to constrain Galactic and Stellar Physics- I- Determining age and mass of thin-disc red-giant stars The cornerstone mission Gaia, together with complementary surveys, will  revolutionize our understanding of the formation and history of our Galaxy, providing accurate stellar masses, radii, ages, distances, as well as chemical properties for a very large sample of stars across different Galactic stellar populations.Using an improved population synthesis approach and new stellar evolution models we attempt to evaluate the possibility of deriving ages and masses of clump stars from their chemical properties.A new version of the Besancon Galaxy model (BGM) uses new stellar evolutionary tracks computed with STAREVOL.These provide chemical and seismic properties from the PMS to the early-AGB.For the first time, the BGM can explore the effects of an extra-mixing occurring in red-giant stars.In particular we focus on the effects of thermohaline instability on chemical properties as well as on the determination of stellar ages and masses using the surface [C/N] abundance ratio.The impact of extra-mixing on 3He, 12C/13C, N, and [C/N] abundances along the giant branch is quantified.We underline the crucial contribution of asteroseismology to discriminate between evolutionary states of field giants belonging to the Galactic disc.The inclusion of thermohaline instability has a significant impact on 12C/13C,3He as well as on the [C/N] values.We show the efficiency of thermohaline mixing at different metallicities and its influence on the determined stellar mass and age from the observed [C/N] ratio.We then propose simple relations to determine ages and masses from chemical abundances according to these models.We emphasize the usefulness of population synthesis tools to test stellar models and transport processes inside stars.We show that transport processes occurring in red-giant stars should be taken into account in the determination of ages for future Galactic archaeology studies.(abridged)"

2017-05-30,2,"A tight relation between the age distributions of stellar clusters and the properties of the interstellar medium in the host galaxy The age distributions of stellar cluster populations have long been proposed to probe the recent formation history of the host galaxy. However, progress is hampered by the limited understanding of cluster disruption by evaporation and tidal shocks. We study the age distributions of clusters in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies, which include a self-consistent, physical model for the formation and dynamical evolution of the cluster population and account for the variation of cluster disruption in time and space. We show that the downward slope of the cluster age distribution due to disruption cannot be reproduced with a single functional form, because the disruption rate exhibits systematic trends with cluster age (the `cruel cradle effect'). This problem is resolved by using the median cluster age to trace cluster disruption. Across 120 independent galaxy snapshots and simulated cluster populations, we perform two-dimensional power law fits of the median cluster age to various macroscopic physical quantities and find that it scales as $t_{\rm med}\propto \Sigma^{-0.51\pm0.03}\sigma_{\rm 1D}^{-0.85\pm0.10}M_{\rm min}^\gamma$, for the gas surface density $\Sigma$, gas velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm 1D}$, and minimum cluster mass $M_{\rm min}$. This scaling accurately describes observed cluster populations and indicates disruption by impulsive tidal shocks from the interstellar medium. The term $M_{\rm min}^\gamma$ provides a model-independent way to measure the mass dependence of the cluster disruption time $\gamma$. Finally, the ensemble-average cluster lifetime depends on the gas density less strongly than the instantaneous disruption time of single clusters. These results reflect the variation of cluster disruption in time and space. We provide quantitative ways of accounting for these physics in cluster population studies."
2017-01-01,2,"Mapping the Milky Way with LAMOST I: Method and overview We present a statistical method to derive the stellar density profiles of the Milky Way from spectroscopic survey data, taking into account selection effects. We assume that the selection function of the spectroscopic survey is only based on photometric colors and magnitudes. Then the underlying selection function can be well recovered by comparing the distribution of the spectroscopic stars in a color-magnitude plane with that of the photometric dataset. Subsequently, the stellar density profile along a line-of-sight can be derived from the spectroscopically measured stellar density profile multiplied by the selection function. The method is validated using Galaxia mock data with two different selection functions. We demonstrate that the derived stellar density profiles well reconstruct the true ones not only for the full targets, but also for the sub-populations selected from the full dataset. Finally, the method is applied to map the density profiles for the Galactic disk and halo, respectively, using the LAMOST RGB stars. The Galactic disk extends to about R = 19 kpc, where the disk still contributes about 10% to the total stellar surface density. Beyond this radius, the disk smoothly transitions to the halo without any truncation, bending, or breaking. Moreover, no over-density corresponding to the Monoceros ring is found in the Galactic anti-center direction. The disk shows north-south asymmetry when at radii larger than 12 kpc. On the other hand, the R--Z tomographic map directly shows that the stellar halo is substantially oblate within a Galactocentric radius of 20 kpc and gradually becomes nearly spherical beyond 30 kpc."

2017-01-01,2,"Galactic Doppelganger: The chemical similarity among field stars and among stars with a common birth origin We explore to which extent stars within Galactic disk open clusters  resemble each other in the high-dimensional space of their photospheric element abundances, and contrast this with pairs of field stars. Our analysis is based on abundances for 20 elements, homogeneously derived from APOGEE spectra (with carefully quantified uncertainties, with a median value of $\sim 0.03$ dex). We consider 90 red giant stars in seven open clusters and find that most stars within a cluster have abundances in most elements that are indistinguishable (in a $\chi^2$-sense) from those of the other members, as expected for stellar birth siblings. An analogous analysis among pairs of $>1000$ field stars shows that highly significant abundance differences in the 20-dimensional space can be established for the vast majority of these pairs, and that the APOGEE-based abundance measurements have high discriminating power. However, pairs of field stars whose abundances are indistinguishable even at 0.03~dex precision exist: $\sim 0.3$ percent of all field star pairs, and $\sim 1.0$ percent of field star pairs at the same (solar) metallicity [Fe/H] = $0 \pm 0.02$. Most of these pairs are presumably not birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather doppelganger. Our analysis implies that 'chemical tagging' in the strict sense, identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars through their abundance similarity alone, will not work with such data. However, our approach shows that abundances have extremely valuable information for probabilistic chemo-orbital modeling and combined with velocities, we have identified new cluster members from the field."
2016-11-23,2,"A Milky Way with a massive, centrally concentrated thick disc: new Galactic mass models for orbit computations In this work, two new axisymmetric models for the Galactic mass distribution are presented. Motivated by recent results, these two models include the contribution of a stellar thin disc and of a thick disc, as massive as the thin counterpart but with a shorter scale-length. Both models satisfy a number of observational constraints: stellar densities at the solar vicinity, thin and thick disc scale lengths and heights, rotation curve(s), and the absolute value of the perpendicular force Kz as a function of distance to the Galactic centre. We numerically integrate into these new models the motion of all Galactic globular clusters for which distances, proper motions, and radial velocities are available, and the orbits of about one thousand stars in the solar vicinity. The retrieved orbital characteristics are compared to those obtained by integrating the clusters and stellar orbits in pure thin disc models. We find that, due to the possible presence of a thick disc, the computed orbital parameters of disc stars can vary by as much as 30-40%. We also show that the systematic uncertainties that affect the rotation curve still plague computed orbital parameters of globular clusters by similar amounts."
2018-02-01,2,"Fast estimation of orbital parameters in Milky-Way-like potentials Orbital parameters, such as the eccentricity and maximum vertical excursion, of stars in the Milky Way are an important tool for understanding its dynamics and evolution, but the calculation of such parameters usually relies on computationally-expensive numerical orbit integration. We present and test a fast method for estimating these parameters using an adaptation of the St\""ackel fudge used previously for the estimation of action-angle variables. We show that the method is highly accurate, to a level of $<1\%$ in eccentricity, over a large range of relevant orbits and in different Milky Way-like potentials, and demonstrate its efficiency by estimating the eccentricity distribution of the RAVE-TGAS data set. This method will, for example, allow the orbital characteristics of the $>1$ billion Gaia stars to be computed in a few hours of cpu time that is trivially parallelised, $\sim 3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude faster than using numerical orbit integration."
2017-01-01,2,"Constraining the Milky Way assembly history with Galactic Archaeology The aim of Galactic Archaeology is to recover the evolutionary history of the Milky Way from its present day kinematical and chemical state. Because stars move away from their birth sites, the current dynamical information alone is not sufficient for this task. The chemical composition of stellar atmospheres, on the other hand, is largely preserved over the stellar lifetime and, together with accurate ages, can be used to recover the birthplaces of stars currently found at the same Galactic radius. In addition to the availability of large stellar samples with accurate 6D kinematics and chemical abundance measurements, this requires detailed modeling with both dynamical and chemical evolution taken into account. An important first step is to understand the variety of dynamical processes that can take place in the Milky Way, including the perturbative effects of both internal (bar and spiral structure) and external (infalling satellites) agents. We discuss here (1) how to constrain the Galactic bar, spiral structure, and merging satellites by their effect on the local and global disc phase-space, (2) the effect of multiple patterns on the disc dynamics, and (3) the importance of radial migration and merger perturbations for the formation of the Galactic thick disc. Finally, we discuss the construction of Milky Way chemo-dynamical models and relate to observations."
2017-01-01,2,"Infalling Young Clusters in the Galactic Centre: implications for IMBHs and young stellar populations The central parsec of the Milky Way hosts two puzzlingly young stellar  populations, a tight isotropic distribution of B stars around SgrA* (the S-stars) and a disk of OB stars extending to ~0.5pc. Using a modified version of Sverre Aarseth's direct summation code NBODY6 we explore the scenario in which a young star cluster migrates to the Galactic Centre within the lifetime of the OB disk population via dynamical friction. We find that star clusters massive and dense enough to reach the central parsec form a very massive star via physical collisions on a mass segregation timescale. We follow the evolution of the merger product using the most up to date, yet conservative, mass loss recipes for very massive stars. Over a large range of initial conditions, we find that the very massive star expels most of its mass via a strong stellar wind, eventually collapsing to form a black hole of mass 20 - 400 M_Sun, incapable of bringing massive stars to the Galactic Centre. No massive intermediate mass black hole can form in this scenario. The presence of a star cluster in the central ~10 pc within the last 15 Myr would also leave a ~2 pc ring of massive stars, which is not currently observed. Thus, we conclude that the star cluster migration model is highly unlikely to be the origin of either young population, and in-situ formation models or binary disruptions are favoured."

Because of its high level of abstraction with little human intervention, deep learning appears to be a promising approach. Deep learning is a rapidly growing discipline that models high-level patterns in data as complex multilayered networks. In this work we test the ability of deep convolutional networks to provide parametric properties of Hubble Space Telescope like galaxies (half-light radii, Sersic indices, total flux etc..). We simulate a set of galaxies including point spread function and realistic noise from the CANDELS survey and try to recover the main galaxy parameters using deep-learning.

2016-08-10,2,"The age-metallicity relation in the solar neighbourhood from a pilot sample of white dwarf-main sequence binaries The age-metallicity relation (AMR) is a fundamental observational constraint for understanding how the Galactic disc formed and evolved chemically in time. However, there is not yet an agreement on the observational properties of the AMR for the solar neighbourhood, primarily due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate stellar ages for individual field stars. We have started an observational campaign for providing the much needed observational input by using wide white dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binaries. White dwarfs are natural clocks and can be used to derive accurate ages. Metallicities can be obtained from the main sequence companions. Since the progenitors of white dwarfs and the main sequence stars were born at the same time, WDMS binaries provide a unique opportunity to observationally constrain in a robust way the properties of the AMR. In this work we present the AMR derived from analysing a pilot sample of 23 WDMS binaries and provide clear observational evidence for the lack of correlation between age and metallicity at young and intermediate ages (0-7 Gyrs)."

2016-09-07,3,"Convolution kernels for multi-wavelength imaging Astrophysical images issued from different instruments and/or spectral bands often require to be processed together, either for fitting or comparison purposes. However each image is affected by an instrumental response, also known as PSF, that depends on the characteristics of the instrument as well as the wavelength and the observing strategy. Given the knowledge of the PSF in each band, a straightforward way of processing images is to homogenise them all to a target PSF using convolution kernels, so that they appear as if they had been acquired by the same instrument. We propose an algorithm that generates such PSF-matching kernels, based on Wiener filtering with a tunable regularisation parameter. This method ensures all anisotropic features in the PSFs to be taken into account. We compare our method to existing procedures using measured Herschel/PACS and SPIRE PSFs and simulated JWST/MIRI PSFs. Significant gains up to two orders of magnitude are obtained with respect to the use of kernels computed assuming Gaussian or circularised PSFs."
2016-09-05,3,"Astronomical Data Fusion Tool Based on PostgreSQL With the application of advanced astronomical technologies, equipments and methods all over the world, astronomy covers from radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray band, and enters into the era of full wavelength astronomy. How to effectively integrate data from different ground- and space-based observation equipments, different observers, different bands, different observation time, requires the data fusion technology. In this paper we introduce the cross-match tool that is developed by the Python language and based on the PostgreSQL database and uses Q3C as the core index, facilitating the cross-match work of massive astronomical data. It provides four different cross-match functions, namely: I) cross-match of custom error range; II) cross-match of catalog error; III) cross-match based on the elliptic error range; IV) cross-match of the nearest algorithm. The cross-match result set provides good foundation for subsequent data mining and statistics based on multiwavelength data. The most advantage of this tool is a user-oriented tool applied locally by users. By means of this tool, users may easily create their own databases, manage their own data and cross-match databases according to their requirements. In addition, this tool is also able to transfer data from one database into another database. More importantly, the tool is easy to get started and used by astronomers without writing any code."
2016-07-29,3,"3D visualization of astronomy data cubes using immersive displays We report on an exploratory project aimed at performing immersive 3D visualization of astronomical data, starting with spectral-line radio data cubes from galaxies. This work is done as a collaboration between the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manitoba. We are building our prototype using the 3D engine Unity, because of its ease of use for integration with advanced displays such as a CAVE environment, a zSpace tabletop, or virtual reality headsets. We address general issues regarding 3D visualization, such as: load and convert astronomy data, perform volume rendering on the GPU, and produce physically meaningful visualizations using principles of visual literacy. We discuss some challenges to be met when designing a user interface that allows us to take advantage of this new way of exploring data. We hope to lay the foundations for an innovative framework useful for all astronomers who use spectral line data cubes, and encourage interested parties to join our efforts. This pilot project addresses the challenges presented by frontier astronomy experiments, such as the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors."
2016-05-18,3,"Cluster-lensing: A Python Package for Galaxy Clusters & Miscentering We describe a new open source package for calculating properties of galaxy clusters, including NFW halo profiles with and without the effects of cluster miscentering. This pure-Python package, cluster-lensing, provides well-documented and easy-to-use classes and functions for calculating cluster scaling relations, including mass-richness and mass-concentration relations from the literature, as well as the surface mass density $\Sigma(R)$ and differential surface mass density $\Delta\Sigma(R)$ profiles, probed by weak lensing magnification and shear. Galaxy cluster miscentering is especially a concern for stacked weak lensing shear studies of galaxy clusters, where offsets between the assumed and the true underlying matter distribution can lead to a significant bias in the mass estimates if not accounted for. This software has been developed and released in a public GitHub repository, and is licensed under the permissive MIT license. The cluster-lensing package is archived on Zenodo (Ford 2016).

2016-04-22,3,"Cygrid: A fast Cython-powered convolution-based gridding module for Python Data gridding is a common task in astronomy and many other science disciplines. It refers to the resampling of irregularly sampled data to a regular grid. We present cygrid, a library module for the general purpose programming language Python. Cygrid can be used to resample data to any collection of target coordinates, although its typical application involves FITS maps or data cubes. The FITS world coordinate system standard is supported. The regridding algorithm is based on the convolution of the original samples with a kernel of arbitrary shape. We introduce a lookup table scheme that allows us to parallelize the gridding and combine it with the HEALPix tessellation of the sphere for fast neighbor searches. We show that for $n$ input data points, cygrids runtime scales between O(n) and O(n log n) and analyze the performance gain that is achieved using multiple CPU cores. We also compare the gridding speed with other techniques, such as nearest-neighbor, and linear and cubic spline interpolation. Cygrid is a very fast and versatile gridding library that significantly outperforms other third-party Python modules, such as the linear and cubic spline interpolation provided by SciPy."
2016-04-14,3,"Towards automatic classification of all WISE sources The WISE satellite has detected hundreds of millions sources over the entire sky. Classifying them reliably is however a challenging task due to degeneracies in WISE multicolour space and low levels of detection in its two longest-wavelength bandpasses. Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and reliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source classification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification will employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those reliably measured for a majority of sources. For the automatic classification we applied the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm, which requires a training sample with relevant classes already identified, and we chose to use the SDSS spectroscopic dataset for that purpose. By calibrating the classifier on the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel is preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset. Next, using three classification parameters (W1 magnitude, W1-W2 colour, and a differential aperture magnitude) we obtained very good classification efficiency in all the tests. At the bright end, the completeness for stars and galaxies reaches ~95%, deteriorating to ~80% at W1=16 mag, while for quasars it stays at a level of ~95% independently of magnitude. Similar numbers are obtained for purity. Application of the classifier to full-sky WISE data, flux-limited to 16 mag (Vega) in the 3.4 $\mu$m channel, and appropriate a posteriori cleaning allowed us to obtain reliably-looking catalogues of star and galaxy candidates. However, the sources flagged by the classifier as `quasars' are in fact dominated by dusty galaxies but also exhibit contamination from sources located mainly at low ecliptic latitudes, consistent with Solar System objects."
2016-04,3,"MATISSE: A novel tool to access, visualize and analyse data from planetary exploration missions The increasing number and complexity of planetary exploration space missions require new tools to access, visualize and analyse data to improve their scientific return. ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) addresses this request with the web-tool MATISSE (Multi-purpose Advanced Tool for the Instruments of the Solar System Exploration), allowing the visualization of single observation or real-time computed high-order products, directly projected on the three-dimensional model of the selected target body. Using MATISSE it will be no longer needed to download huge quantity of data or to write down a specific code for every instrument analysed, greatly encouraging studies based on joint analysis of different datasets. In addition the extremely high-resolution output, to be used offline with a Python-based free software, together with the files to be read with specific GIS software, makes it a valuable tool to further process the data at the best spatial accuracy available. MATISSE modular structure permits addition of new missions or tasks and, thanks to dedicated future developments, it would be possible to make it compliant to the Planetary Virtual Observatory standards currently under definition. In this context the recent development of an interface to the NASA ODE REST API by which it is possible to access to public repositories is set."
2016-03-23,3,"BEANS - a software package for distributed Big Data analysis BEANS software is a web based, easy to install and maintain, new tool to store and analyse data in a distributed way for a massive amount of data. It provides a clear interface for querying, filtering, aggregating, and plotting data from an arbitrary number of datasets. Its main purpose is to simplify the process of storing, examining and finding new relations in the so-called Big Data. Creation of BEANS software is an answer to the growing needs of the astronomical community to have a versatile tool to store, analyse and compare the complex astrophysical numerical simulations with observations (e.g. simulations of the Galaxy or star clusters with the Gaia archive). However, this software was built in a general form and it is ready to use in any other research field or open source software."
2012-03-16,3,"Computational statistics using the Bayesian Inference Engine This paper introduces the Bayesian Inference Engine (BIE), a general parallel, optimised software package for parameter inference and model selection. This package is motivated by the analysis needs of modern astronomical surveys and the need to organise and reuse expensive derived data. The BIE is the first platform for computational statistics designed explicitly to enable Bayesian update and model comparison for astronomical problems. Bayesian update is based on the representation of high-dimensional posterior distributions using metric-ball-tree based kernel density estimation. Among its algorithmic offerings, the BIE emphasises hybrid tempered MCMC schemes that robustly sample multimodal posterior distributions in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Moreover, the BIE is implements a full persistence or serialisation system that stores the full byte-level image of the running inference and previously characterised posterior distributions for later use. Two new algorithms to compute the marginal likelihood from the posterior distribution, developed for and implemented in the BIE, enable model comparison for complex models and data sets. Finally, the BIE was designed to be a collaborative platform for applying Bayesian methodology to astronomy. It includes an extensible object-oriented and easily extended framework that implements every aspect of the Bayesian inference. By providing a variety of statistical algorithms for all phases of the inference problem, a scientist may explore a variety of approaches with a single model and data implementation. Additional technical details and download details are available from http://www.astro.umass.edu/bie. The BIE is distributed under the GNU GPL."

AST provides a comprehensive range of facilities for attaching world co-ordinate systems to astronomical data, and for retrieving and interpreting that information in a variety of formats, including FITS-WCS. AST is a mature system that has been in use for more than 17 years, and may consequently be useful as a means of informing development of similar systems in the future."
2016-08-17,3,"A hierarchical Bayesian approach for reconstructing the Initial Mass Function of Single Stellar Populations Recent studies based on the integrated light of distant galaxies suggest that the initial mass function (IMF) might not be universal. Variations of the IMF with galaxy type and/or formation time may have important consequences for our understanding of galaxy evolution. We have developed a new stellar population synthesis (SPS) code specifically designed to reconstruct the IMF. We implement a novel approach combining regularization with hierarchical Bayesian inference. Within this approach we use a parametrized IMF prior to regulate a direct inference of the IMF. This direct inference gives more freedom to the IMF and allows the model to deviate from parametrized models when demanded by the data. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to reconstruct the best parameters for the IMF prior, the age, and the metallicity of a single stellar population. We present our code and apply our model to a number of mock single stellar populations with different ages, metallicities, and IMFs. When systematic uncertainties are not significant, we are able to reconstruct the input parameters that were used to create the mock populations. Our results show that if systematic uncertainties do play a role, this may introduce a bias on the results. Therefore, it is important to objectively compare different ingredients of SPS models. Through its Bayesian framework, our model is well-suited for this."
2016-05-09,3,"ComEst: a Completeness Estimator of Source Extraction on Astronomical Imaging The completeness of source detection is critical for analyzing the photometric and spatial properties of the population of interest observed by astronomical imaging. We present a software package $\mathtt{ComEst}$, which calculates the completeness of source detection on charge-coupled device (CCD) images of astronomical observations, especially for the optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging of galaxies and point sources. The completeness estimator $\mathtt{ComEst}$ is designed for the source finder $\mathtt{SExtractor}$ used on the CCD images saved in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format. Specifically, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ estimates the completeness of the source detection by deriving the detection rate of synthetic point sources and galaxies simulated on the observed CCD images. In order to capture any observational artifacts or noise properties while deriving the completeness, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ directly carries out the detection of simulated sources on the observed images. Given an observed CCD image saved in FITS format, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ derives the completeness of the source detection from end to end as a function of source flux (or magnitude) and CCD position. In addition, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ can also estimate the purity of the source detection by comparing the catalog of the detected sources to the input catalogs of the simulated sources. We run ComEst on the images from Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and compare the derived completeness as a function of magnitude to the limiting magnitudes derived by using the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and number count histogram of the detected sources. $\mathtt{ComEst}$ is released as a Python package with an easy-to-use syntax and is publicly available at https://github.com/inonchiu/ComEst"
2016-12-14,3,"Linear feature detection algorithm for astronomical surveys - I. Algorithm description Computer vision algorithms are powerful tools in astronomical image analyses, especially when automatization of object detection and extraction is required. Modern object detection algorithms in astronomy are oriented towards detection of stars and galaxies, ignoring completely detection of existing linear features. With the emergence of wide field sky surveys, linear features attract scientific interest as possible trails of fast flybys of near-Earth asteroids and meteors. In this work we describe a new linear feature detection algorithm designed specifically for implementation in Big Data astronomy. The algorithm combines a series of algorithmic steps that first remove other objects (stars, galaxies) from the image and then enhance the line to enable more efficient line detection with the Hough algorithm. The rate of false positives is greatly reduced thanks to a step that replaces possible line segments with rectangles and then compares lines fitted to the rectangles with the lines obtained directly from the image. The speed of the algorithm and its applicability in astronomical surveys are also discussed."
2015-05-29,3,"Chimenea and other tools: Automated imaging of multi-epoch radio-synthesis data with CASA In preparing the way for the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders, there is a pressing need to begin probing the transient sky in a fully robotic fashion using the current generation of radio telescopes. Effective exploitation of such surveys requires a largely automated data-reduction process. This paper introduces an end-to-end automated reduction pipeline, AMIsurvey, used for calibrating and imaging data from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array. AMIsurvey makes use of several component libraries which have been packaged separately for open-source release. The most scientifically significant of these is chimenea, which implements a telescope-agnostic algorithm for automated imaging of pre-calibrated multi-epoch radio-synthesis data, of the sort typically acquired for transient surveys or follow-up. The algorithm aims to improve upon standard imaging pipelines by utilizing iterative RMS-estimation and automated source-detection to avoid so called `Clean-bias', and makes use of CASA subroutines for the underlying image-synthesis operations. At a lower level, AMIsurvey relies upon two libraries, drive-ami and drive-casa, built to allow use of mature radio-astronomy software packages from within Python scripts. While targeted at automated imaging, the drive-casa interface can also be used to automate interaction with any of the CASA subroutines from a generic Python process. Additionally, these packages may be of wider technical interest beyond radio-astronomy, since they demonstrate use of the Python library pexpect to emulate terminal interaction with an external process. This approach allows for rapid development of a Python interface to any legacy or externally-maintained pipeline which accepts command-line input, without requiring alterations to the original code."

2009,3,Simulating Magnetohydrodynamical Flow with Constrained Transport and Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Tests of the AstroBEAR Code A description is given of the algorithms implemented in the AstroBEAR adaptive mesh-refinement code for ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The code provides several high-resolution shock-capturing schemes which are constructed to maintain conserved quantities of the flow in a finite-volume sense. Divergence-free magnetic field topologies are maintained to machine precision by collating the components of the magnetic field on a cell-interface staggered grid and utilizing the constrained transport approach for integrating the induction equations. The maintenance of magnetic field topologies on adaptive grids is achieved using prolongation and restriction operators which preserve the divergence and curl of the magnetic field across collocated grids of different resolutions. The robustness and correctness of the code is demonstrated by comparing the numerical solution of various tests with analytical solutions or previously published numerical solutions obtained by other codes.
2017-02-01,3,"What can the programming language Rust do for astrophysics? The astrophysics community uses different tools for computational tasks such as complex systems simulations, radiative transfer calculations or big data. Programming languages like Fortran, C or C++ are commonly present in these tools and, generally, the language choice was made based on the need for performance. However, this comes at a cost: safety. For instance, a common source of error is the access to invalid memory regions, which produces random execution behaviors and affects the scientific interpretation of the results. In 2015, Mozilla Research released the first stable version of a new programming language named Rust. Many features make this new language attractive for the scientific community, it is open source and it guarantees memory safety while offering zero-cost abstraction. We explore the advantages and drawbacks of Rust for astrophysics by re-implementing the fundamental parts of Mercury-T, a Fortran code that simulates the dynamical and tidal evolution of multi-planet systems."
2017-02-01,3,"Estimating Extinction using Unsupervised Machine Learning Dust extinction is the most robust tracer of the gas distribution in the interstellar medium, but measuring extinction is limited by the systematic uncertainties involved in estimating the intrinsic colors to background stars. In this paper we present a new technique, PNICER, that estimates intrinsic colors and extinction for individual stars using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the column density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any combination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions. Furthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single sources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction vector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes possible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability densities. PNICER effectively eliminates known biases found in similar methods and outperforms them in cases of deep observational data where the number of background galaxies is significant, or when a large number of parameters is used to break degeneracies in the intrinsic color distributions. This new method remains computationally competitive, making it possible to correctly de-redden millions of sources within a matter of seconds. With the ever-increasing number of large-scale high-sensitivity imaging surveys, PNICER offers a fast and reliable way to efficiently calculate extinction for arbitrary parameter combinations without prior information on source characteristics. PNICER also offers access to the well-established NICER technique in a simple unified interface and is capable of building extinction maps including the NICEST correction for cloud substructure. PNICER is offered to the community as an open-source software solution and is entirely written in Python."

2017-05-01,3,"Knowledge discovery through text-based similarity searches for astronomy literature The increase in the number of researchers coupled with the ease of  publishing and distribution of scientific papers (due to technological advancements) has resulted in a dramatic increase in astronomy literature. This has likely led to the predicament that the body of the literature is too large for traditional human consumption and that related and crucial knowledge is not discovered by researchers. In addition to the increased production of astronomical literature, recent decades have also brought several advancements in computer linguistics. Especially, the machine aided processing of literature dissemination might make it possible to convert this stream of papers into a coherent knowledge set. In this paper, we present the application of computer linguistics techniques on astronomy literature. In particular, we developed a tool that will find similar articles purely based on text content given an input paper. We find that our technique performs robustly in comparison with other tools recommending articles given a reference papers (known as recommender system). Our novel tool shows the great power in combining computer linguistics with astronomy literature and suggests that additional research in this endeavor will likely produce even better tools that will help researchers cope with the vast amounts of knowledge being produced."

ProFit consists of a low-level C++ library (libprofit), accessible via a command-line interface and documented API, along with high-level R (ProFit) and Python (PyProFit) interfaces (available at github.com/ICRAR/ libprofit, github.com/ICRAR/ProFit, and github.com/ICRAR/pyprofit respectively). R ProFit is also available pre-built from CRAN, however this version will be slightly behind the latest GitHub version. libprofit offers fast and accurate two- dimensional integration for a useful number of profiles, including Sersic, Core-Sersic, broken-exponential, Ferrer, Moffat, empirical King, point-source and sky, with a simple mechanism for adding new profiles. We show detailed comparisons between libprofit and GALFIT. libprofit is both faster and more accurate than GALFIT at integrating the ubiquitous Serrsic profile for the most common values of the Serrsic index n (0.5 < n < 8). The high-level fitting code ProFit is tested on a sample of galaxies with both SDSS and deeper KiDS imaging. We find good agreement in the fit parameters, with larger scatter in best-fit parameters from fitting images from different sources (SDSS vs KiDS) than from using different codes (ProFit vs GALFIT). A large suite of Monte Carlo-simulated images are used to assess prospects for automated bulge-disc decomposition with ProFit on SDSS, KiDS and future LSST imaging. We find that the biggest increases in fit quality come from moving from SDSS- to KiDS-quality data, with less significant gains moving from KiDS to LSST."
2017-01-01,3,"Vizic: A Jupyter-based Interactive Visualization Tool for Astronomical Catalogs The ever-growing datasets in observational astronomy have challenged scientists in many aspects, including an efficient and interactive data exploration and visualization. Many tools have been developed to confront this challenge. However, they usually focus on displaying the actual images or focus on visualizing patterns within catalogs in a predefined way. In this paper we introduce Vizic, a Python visualization library that builds the connection between images and catalogs through an interactive map of the sky region. Vizic visualizes catalog data over a custom background canvas using the shape, size and orientation of each object in the catalog. The displayed objects in the map are highly interactive and customizable comparing to those in the images. These objects can be filtered by or colored by their property values, such as redshift and magnitude. They also can be sub-selected using a lasso-like tool for further analysis using standard Python functions from inside a Jupyter notebook. Furthermore, Vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of the sky map. We have initially implemented several overlays, namely, Voronoi, Delaunay, Minimum Spanning Tree and HEALPix layers, which are helpful for visualizing large-scale structure. All these overlays can be generated, added or removed dynamically with just one line of code. The catalog data is kept in a non-relational database, and the interfaces were developed in JavaScript and Python to work within Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create custom widgets, user generated scripts to analyze and plot the data selected/displayed in the interactive map. This unique design makes Vizic a very powerful and flexible interactive analysis tool. Vizic can be adopted in variety of exercises, for example, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies, outlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations."

We show that our results are in good agreement with the CMD ages for both models, and that metallicity does not affect the age determination for the full spectrum fitting method regardless of the model used for ages with log (age/year) $<$ 9. We discuss the results obtained by the two statistical results for both GALAXEV and MILES versus three factors: age, S/N and resolution (FWHM). The predicted reddening values when using the $\chi^{2}$ minimization method are within the range found in the literature for resolved clusters (i.e: $<$ 0.35), however the K-S test can predict E(B$-$V) higher values. The sharp spectrum transition originated at ages around the supergiants contribution, at either side of the AGB peak around log (age/year) 9.0 and log (age/year) 7.8 are limiting our ability to provide values in agreement with the CMD estimates and as a result the reddening determination is not accurate.

This offset is used to calibrate the target’s instrumental magnitude. The software application was used to calibrate magnitudes for six Be/X-ray binary sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the results were compared with published results for these sources. Where comparisons were possible, our results agreed with those results within the uncertainties specified. Infrared variability was found for all six of the sources tested. The interactive outlier removal that was made possible by our software allowed for smaller uncertainties to be reported for our results.The AutoCal software is openly available here:&nbsp;http://hdl.handle.net/11660/2382"

Its visualization capabilities focus on enabling interactive exploration of large static local tables - millions of rows and hundreds of columns can easily be handled on a standard desktop or laptop machine, and various options are provided for meaningful graphical representation of such large datasets. TOPCAT has been developed in the context of astronomy, but many of its features are equally applicable to other domains. The software, which is free and open source, is written in Java, and the underlying high-performance visualisation library is suitable for re-use in other applications."
2012-06-01,3,"Principles of high-dimensional data visualization in astronomy Astronomical researchers often think of analysis and visualization as separate tasks. In the case of high-dimensional data sets, though, interactive exploratory data visualization can give far more insight than an approach where data processing and statistical analysis are followed, rather than accompanied, by visualization. This paper attempts to charts a course toward “linked view” systems, where multiple views of high-dimensional data sets update live as a researcher selects, highlights, or otherwise manipulates, one of several open views. For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization of simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays of the data set's properties (such as an x -y plot of temperature vs. velocity, or a histogram of vorticities). Then, imagine that when the researcher selects an interesting group of points in any one of these displays, that the same points become a highlighted subset in all other open displays. Selections can be graphical or algorithmic, and they can be combined, and saved. For tabular (ASCII) data, this kind of analysis has long been possible, even though it has been under-used in astronomy. The bigger issue for astronomy and other “high-dimensional” fields, though, is that no extant system allows for full integration of images and data cubes within a linked-view environment. The paper concludes its history and analysis of the present situation with suggestions that look toward cooperatively-developed open-source modular software as a way to create an evolving, flexible, high-dimensional, linked-view visualization environment useful in astro-physical research (© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We describe the numerous features of this numerical tool and present its relevance when applied to astrophysical archival research. We exploit WebPlotDigitizer to extract ultraviolet spectropolarimetric spectra from old publications that used the Hubble Space Telescope, Lick Observatory 3m Shane telescope and Astro-2 mission to observe the Seyfert-2 AGN NGC 1068. By doing so, we compile all the existing ultraviolet polarimetric data on NGC 1068 to prepare the ground for further investigations with the future high-resolution spectropolarimeter POLLUX on-board of the proposed Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) NASA mission."
2018-02-14,3,"Machine learning cosmological structure formation We train a machine learning algorithm to learn cosmological structure formation from N-body simulations. The algorithm infers the relationship between the initial conditions and the final dark matter haloes, without the need to introduce approximate halo collapse models. We gain insights into the physics driving halo formation by evaluating the predictive performance of the algorithm when provided with different types of information about the local environment around dark matter particles. The algorithm learns to predict whether or not dark matter particles will end up in haloes of a given mass range, based on spherical overdensities. We show that the resulting predictions match those of spherical collapse approximations such as extended Press-Schechter theory. Additional information on the shape of the local gravitational potential is not able to improve halo collapse predictions; the linear density field contains sufficient information for the algorithm to also reproduce ellipsoidal collapse predictions based on the Sheth-Tormen model. We investigate the algorithm's performance in terms of halo mass and radial position and perform blind analyses on independent initial conditions realisations to demonstrate the generality of our results.

2005-03-25,3,"Improving the Efficiency of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Analyzing the  Orbits of Extrasolar Planets Precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of ~170 extrasolar planetary systems. Understanding the uncertainties in the orbital solutions will become increasingly important as the discovery space for extrasolar planets shifts to planets with smaller masses and longer orbital periods. The method of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides a rigorous method for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital parameters in a Bayesian framework (Ford 2005a). The main practical challenge for the general application of MCMC is the need to construct Markov chains which quickly converge. The rate of convergence is very sensitive to the choice of the candidate transition probability distribution function (CTPDF). Here we explain one simple method for generating alternative CTPDFs which can significantly speed convergence by one to three orders of magnitude. We have numerically tested dozens of CTPDFs with simulated radial velocity data sets to identify those which perform well for different types of orbits and suggest a set of CTPDFs for general application. Additionally, we introduce other refinements to the MCMC algorithm for radial velocity planets, including an improved treatment of the uncertainties in the radial velocity observations, an algorithm for automatically choosing step sizes, an algorithm for automatically determining reasonable stopping times, and the use of importance sampling for including the dynamical evolution of multiple planet systems. Together, these improvements make it practical to apply MCMC to multiple planet systems. We demonstrate the improvements in efficiency by analyzing a variety of extrasolar planetary systems. "
2012-06-01,3,"EzGal: A Flexible Interface for Stellar Population Synthesis Models We present EzGal, a flexible Python program designed to easily generate observable parameters (magnitudes, colors, and mass-to-light ratios) for arbitrary input stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. As has been demonstrated by various authors, for many applications the choice of input SPS models can be a significant source of systematic uncertainty. A key strength of EzGal is that it enables simple, direct comparison of different model sets so that the uncertainty introduced by choice of model set can be quantified. Its ability to work with new models will allow EzGal to remain useful as SPS modeling evolves to keep up with the latest research (such as varying IMFs). EzGal is also capable of generating composite stellar population models (CSPs) for arbitrary input star-formation histories and reddening laws, and it can be used to interpolate between metallicities for a given model set. To facilitate use, we have created an online interface to run EzGal and quickly generate magnitude and mass-to-light ratio predictions for a variety of star-formation histories and model sets. We make many commonly used SPS models available from the online interface, including the canonical Bruzual & Charlot models, an updated version of these models, the Maraston models, the BaSTI models, and the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) models. We use EzGal to compare magnitude predictions for the model sets as a function of wavelength, age, metallicity, and star-formation history. From this comparison we quickly recover the well-known result that the models agree best in the optical for old solar-metallicity models, with differences at the ˜0.1 level. Similarly, the most problematic regime for SPS modeling is for young ages (≲2 Gyr) and long wavelengths (λ≳7500 Å), where thermally pulsating AGB stars are important and scatter between models can vary from 0.3 mag (Sloan i) to 0.7 mag (Ks). We find that these differences are not caused by one discrepant model set and should therefore be interpreted as general uncertainties in SPS modeling. Finally, we connect our results to a more physically motivated example by generating CSPs with a star-formation history matching the global star-formation history of the universe. We demonstrate that the wavelength and age dependence of SPS model uncertainty translates into a redshift-dependent model uncertainty, highlighting the importance of a quantitative understanding of model differences when comparing observations with models as a function of redshift."
2018-02-16,3,"Two- and Multi-dimensional Curve Fitting using Bayesian Inference Fitting models to data using Bayesian inference is quite common, but when each point in parameter space gives a curve, fitting the curve to a data set requires new nuisance parameters, which specify the metric embedding the one-dimensional curve into the higher-dimensional space occupied by the data. A generic formalism for curve fitting in the context of Bayesian inference is developed which shows how the aforementioned metric arises. The result is a natural generalization of previous works, and is compared to oft-used frequentist approaches and similar Bayesian techniques. "
2012-09-18,3,"Multi-physics simulations using a hierarchical interchangeable software  interface We introduce a general-purpose framework for interconnecting scientific simulation programs using a homogeneous, unified interface. Our framework is intrinsically parallel, and conveniently separates all component numerical modules in memory. This strict separation allows automatic unit conversion, distributed execution of modules on different cores within a cluster or grid, and orderly recovery from errors. The framework can be efficiently implemented and incurs an acceptable overhead. In practice, we measure the time spent in the framework to be less than 1% of the wall-clock time. Due to the unified structure of the interface, incorporating multiple modules addressing the same physics in different ways is relatively straightforward. Different modules may be advanced serially or in parallel. Despite initial concerns, we have encountered relatively few problems with this strict separation between modules, and the results of our simulations are consistent with earlier results using more traditional monolithic approaches. This framework provides a platform to combine existing simulation codes or develop new physical solver codes within a rich ""ecosystem"" of interchangeable modules. "
2018-02-12,3,"Separation of pulsar signals from noise with supervised machine learning  algorithms We evaluate the performance of four different machine learning (ML) algorithms: an Artificial Neural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN MLP ), Adaboost, Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), XGBoost, for the separation of pulsars from radio frequency interference (RFI) and other sources of noise, using a dataset obtained from the post-processing of a pulsar search pi peline. This dataset was previously used for cross-validation of the SPINN-based machine learning engine, used for the reprocessing of HTRU-S survey data arXiv:1406.3627. We have used Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to deal with high class imbalance in the dataset. We report a variety of quality scores from all four of these algorithms on both the non-SMOTE and SMOTE datasets. For all the above ML methods, we report high accuracy and G-mean in both the non-SMOTE and SMOTE cases. We study the feature importances using Adaboost, GBC, and XGBoost and also from the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance approach to report algorithm-agnostic feature ranking. From these methods, we find that the signal to noise of the folded profile to be the best feature. We find that all the ML algorithms report FPRs about an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding FPRs obtained in arXiv:1406.3627, for the same recall value. "
2014-09-18,3,"Multi-scale and multi-domain computational astrophysics Astronomical phenomena are governed by processes on all spatial and temporal scales, ranging from days to the age of the Universe (13.8,Gyr) as well as from km size up to the size of the Universe. This enormous range in scales is contrived, but as long as there is a physical connection between the smallest and largest scales it is important to be able to resolve them all, and for the study of many astronomical phenomena this governance is present. Although covering all these scales is a challenge for numerical modelers, the most challenging aspect is the equally broad and complex range in physics, and the way in which these processes propagate through all scales. In our recent effort to cover all scales and all relevant physical processes on these scales we have designed the Astrophysics Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). AMUSE is a Python-based framework with production quality community codes and provides a specialized environment to connect this plethora of solvers to a homogeneous problem solving environment. "
2018-02-12,3,"Automatic physical inference Compressing large data sets to a manageable number of summaries that are informative about the underlying parameters vastly simplifies both frequentist and Bayesian inference. When only simulations are available, these summaries are typically chosen heuristically, so they may inadvertently miss important information. We introduce a simulation-based reinforcement learning technique that trains artificial neural networks to find non-linear functionals of data that maximize Fisher information: information maximizing neural networks (IMNNs). In test cases where the posterior can be derived exactly, likelihood-free inference based on automatically derived IMNN summaries produces nearly exact posteriors, showing that these summaries are good approximations to sufficient statistics. In a series of numerical examples of increasing complexity and astrophysical relevance we show that IMNNs are robustly capable of automatically finding optimal, non-linear summaries of the data even in cases where linear compression fails: inferring the variance of Gaussian signal in the presence of noise; inferring cosmological parameters from mock simulations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in quasar spectra; and inferring frequency-domain parameters from LISA-like detections of gravitational waveforms. In this final case, the IMNN summary outperforms linear data compression by avoiding the introduction of spurious likelihood maxima. We anticipate that the automatic physical inference method described in this paper will be essential to obtain both accurate and precise cosmological parameter estimates from complex and large astronomical data sets, including those from LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST.

2018-02-12,3,"Astrolabe: Curating, Linking and Computing Astronomy's Dark Data Where appropriate repositories are not available to support all relevant astronomical data products, data can fall into darkness: unseen and unavailable for future reference and re-use. Some data in this category are legacy or old data, but newer datasets are also often uncurated and could remain ""dark"". This paper provides a description of the design motivation and development of Astrolabe, a cyberinfrastructure project that addresses a set of community recommendations for locating and ensuring the long-term curation of dark or otherwise at-risk data and integrated computing. This paper also describes the outcomes of the series of community workshops that informed creation of Astrolabe. According to participants in these workshops, much astronomical dark data currently exist that are not curated elsewhere, as well as software that can only be executed by a few individuals and therefore becomes unusable because of changes in computing platforms. Additional astronomical research questions and challenges would be better addressed with integrated data and computational resources that fall outside the scope of existing observatory and space mission projects. As a solution, the design of the Astrolabe system is aimed at developing new resources for management of astronomical data. The project is based in CyVerse cyberinfrastructure technology and is a collaboration between the University of Arizona and the American Astronomical Society. Overall the project aims to support open access to research data by leveraging existing cyberinfrastructure resources and promoting scientific discovery by making potentially-useful data in a computable format broadly available to the astronomical community.

2012-12-04,3,"PICACS: self-consistent modelling of galaxy cluster scaling relations In this paper, we introduce PICACS, a physically-motivated, internally consistent model of scaling relations between galaxy cluster masses and their observable properties. This model can be used to constrain simultaneously the form, scatter (including its covariance) and evolution of the scaling relations, as well as the masses of the individual clusters. In this framework, scaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity and temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental mass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being fit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show that it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring individual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on the processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass constraints. Our analysis suggests that the observed combination of slopes of the scaling relations can be described by a deficit of gas in low-mass clusters that is compensated for by elevated gas temperatures, such that the total thermal energy of the gas in a cluster of given mass remains close to self-similar expectations. This is interpreted as the result of AGN feedback removing low entropy gas from low mass systems, while heating the remaining gas. We deconstruct the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation and show that its steepening compared to self-similar expectations can be explained solely by this combination of gas depletion and heating in low mass systems, without any additional contribution from a mass dependence of the gas structure. Finally, we demonstrate that a self-consistent analysis of the scaling relations leads to an expectation of self-similar evolution of the LT relation that is significantly weaker than is commonly assumed."
2014-09-01,3,"The Overlooked Potential of Generalized Linear Models in Astronomy-II: Gamma regression and photometric redshifts Machine learning techniques offer a precious tool box for use within  astronomy to solve problems involving so-called big data. They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the photo-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as ~1% for simulated and ~2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely thousands of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as an user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort from the user. By facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope."

We applied the code to the peak bagging analysis of solar-like oscillations observed in a challenging F-type star. By means of Diamonds one is able to detect the different backgrounds in the power spectrum of the star (e.g. stellar granulation and faculae activity) and to understand whether one or two oscillation peaks can be identified or not. In addition, we demonstrate a novel approach to peak bagging based on multimodality, which is able to reduce significantly the number of free parameters involved in the peak bagging model. This novel approach is therefore of great interest for possible future automatization of the entire analysis technique."

Exponential growth in the data volume and increased complexity of the data augments difficult questions to the existing challenges. Classical problems in Astronomy are compounded by accumulation of astronomical volume of complex data, rendering the task of classification and interpretation incredibly laborious.

An automatic tool to derive structural parameters of semi-resolved star clusters located in crowded stellar fields in nearby galaxies is needed for homogeneous processing of archival frames. Aims. We have developed a program that automatically derives the structural parameters of star clusters and estimates errors by accounting for individual stars and variable sky background. Methods. Models of observed frames consist of the cluster's surface brightness distribution, convolved with a point spread function; the stars, represented by the same point spread function; and a smoothly variable sky background. The cluster's model is fitted within a large radius by using the Levenberg-Marquardt and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to derive structural parameters, the flux of the cluster, and individual fluxes of all well-resolved stars. Results. FitClust, a program to derive structural parameters of semi-resolved clusters in crowded stellar fields, was developed and is available for free use. The program was tested on simulated cluster frames, and was used to measure clusters of the M31 galaxy in Subaru Suprime-Cam frames. Conclusions. Accounting for bright resolved stars and variable sky background significantly improves the accuracy of derived structural parameters of star clusters. However, their uncertainty remains dominated by the stochastic noise of unresolved stars."

2015-04,3,"HOPE: A Python just-in-time compiler for astrophysical computations The Python programming language is becoming increasingly popular for scientific applications due to its simplicity, versatility, and the broad range of its libraries. A drawback of this dynamic language, however, is its low runtime performance which limits its applicability for large simulations and for the analysis of large data sets, as is common in astrophysics and cosmology. While various frameworks have been developed to address this limitation, most focus on covering the complete language set, and either force the user to alter the code or are not able to reach the full speed of an optimised native compiled language. In order to combine the ease of Python and the speed of C++, we developed HOPE, a specialised Python just-in-time (JIT) compiler designed for numerical astrophysical applications. HOPE focuses on a subset of the language and is able to translate Python code into C++ while performing numerical optimisation on mathematical expressions at runtime. To enable the JIT compilation, the user only needs to add a decorator to the function definition. We assess the performance of HOPE by performing a series of benchmarks and compare its execution speed with that of plain Python, C++ and the other existing frameworks. We find that HOPE improves the performance compared to plain Python by a factor of 2 to 120, achieves speeds comparable to that of C++, and often exceeds the speed of the existing solutions. We discuss the differences between HOPE and the other frameworks, as well as future extensions of its capabilities. The fully documented HOPE package is available at http://hope.phys.ethz.ch and is published under the GPLv3 license on PyPI and GitHub."

In this paper, we propose parallel processing recipes for multicore machines for astronomical data processing. The target audience is astronomers who use Python as their preferred scripting language and who may be using PyRAF/IRAF for data processing. Three problems of varied complexity were benchmarked on three different types of multicore processors to demonstrate the benefits, in terms of execution time, of parallelizing data processing tasks.

2001-08-01,3,"A new Monte Carlo code for star cluster simulations. I. Relaxation We have developed a new simulation code aimed at studying the stellar dynamics of a galactic central star cluster surrounding a massive black hole. In order to include all the relevant physical ingredients (2-body relaxation, stellar mass spectrum, collisions, tidal disruption, \ldots), we chose to revive a numerical scheme pioneered by Hénon in the 70's (Hénon \cite{Henon71a},a; Hénon \cite{Henon73}. It is basically a Monte Carlo resolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It can cope with any stellar mass spectrum or velocity distribution. Being a particle-based method, it also allows one to take stellar collisions into account in a very realistic way. This first paper covers the basic version of our code which treats the relaxation-driven evolution of a stellar cluster without a central BH. A technical description of the code is presented, as well as the results of test computations. Thanks to the use of a binary tree to store potential and rank information and of variable time steps, cluster models with up to 2*E6 particles can be simulated on a standard personal computer and the CPU time required scales as Np ln (Np) with the particle number Np. Furthermore, the number of simulated stars needs not be equal to Np but can be arbitrarily larger. A companion paper will treat further physical elements, mostly relevant to galactic nuclei."

2014-08-01,3,"Using Virtual Observatory with Python: querying remote astronomical databases This tutorial is devoted to extending an existing catalogue with data taken elsewhere, either from CDS Vizier or Simbad database. As an example, we used the so-called 'Spectroscopic Survey of Stars in the Solar Neighborhood' (aka. S4N, Allende Prieto et al. 2004) in order to retrieve all objects with available data for the set of fundamental stellar parameters effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity. Then for each object in this dataset we query Simbad database to retrieve the projected rotational velocity. This combines Vizier and Simbad queries made using Python astroquery module. The tutorial covers remote database access, filtering tables with arbitrary criteria, creating and writing your own tables, and basics of plotting in Python."
2015-10-26,3,"CONCEPT - The COsmological $N$-body CodE in PyThon CO$N$CEPT (COsmological $N$-body CodE in PyThon) is a free and open-source code for cosmological $N$-body simulations on massively parallel computers with distributed memory. Collisionless dark matter is the only implemented particle species. Gravity can be computed using the PP, PM or the P$^{3}$M algorithm. The goal of CO$N$CEPT is to make it pleasant to work with cosmological $N$-body simulations - for the cosmologist as well as for the source code developer. This is the user guide. The source code and additional documentation can be found at https://github.com/jmd-dk/concept/"
2018-01-01,3,"Schroedinger's code: A preliminary study on research source code availability and link persistence in astrophysics We examined software usage in a sample set of astrophysics research  articles published in 2015 and searched for source code for the software mentioned in these research papers. We categorized the software to indicate whether source code is available for download and whether there are restrictions to accessing it, and if source code is not available, whether some other form of the software, such as a binary, is. We also extracted hyperlinks from one journal's 2015 research articles, as links in articles can serve as an acknowledgment of software use and lead to data used in the research, and tested them to determine which of these URLs are still accessible. For our sample of 715 software instances in the 166 articles we examined, we were able to categorize 418 records as to availability of source code and found that 285 unique codes were used, 58% of which offer source code available online for download. Of the 2,558 hyperlinks extracted from 1,669 research articles, at best, 90% of them were available over our testing period."
